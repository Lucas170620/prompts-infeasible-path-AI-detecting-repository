**Control Flow Graph (CFG) and Data Flow Graph (DFG) Analysis**

After analyzing the provided code using Control Flow Graph (CFG) and Data Flow Graph (DFG) techniques, we identified **8 infeasible paths**. Here's the breakdown:

### 1. **Infeasible Paths Identified**:
   - **Output Function Else Branch**: The condition `if (code >= 0)` is always true (code is non-negative), making the `else` branch unreachable.
   - **Getbyte Function Else Branch**: The condition `if (InCnt > 0 && (apsim_InCnt-- > 0))` is always true during execution, making the `else` branch unreachable.
   - **Compress Function Condition 1**: The condition `if (((count_int)in_count >= checkpoint) && block_compress` is always false (`in_count` max is 51, `checkpoint` is 10000), making its `then` branch unreachable.
   - **Compress Function Condition 2**: The condition `else if (free_ent >= maxmaxcode)` is always false (`free_ent` max is 307, `maxmaxcode` is 65536), making this branch unreachable.
   - **Cl_block Function Paths (4 paths)**: The function `cl_block` is never called, rendering all 4 internal paths (combinations of conditions `in_count > 0x007fffff` and `rat > ratio`) infeasible.

### 2. **Explanation**:
   - **CFG Analysis**: The CFG revealed unreachable branches due to contradictions in conditions (e.g., `in_count` too small for `checkpoint`).
   - **DFG Analysis**: Data dependencies (e.g., `free_ent` never reaches `maxmaxcode`) and dead code (`cl_block` never called) confirmed these paths are infeasible.

### 3. **Conclusion**:
   The code contains **8 infeasible paths** due to logical contradictions, dead code, and unmet conditions.

**Final Answer: 8**
