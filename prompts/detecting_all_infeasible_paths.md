**Analysis of Infeasible Paths in Code - Structural Testing Expert**

**Input Instructions:**  
Provide:  
1. The source code to be analyzed  
2. For each function in the code, include:  
   - The corresponding **CDFG (Control Data Flow Graph)**, representing all nodes (operations/basic blocks) and edges (control flows)  
   - A **preliminary analysis** indicating potential *infeasible paths* identified  

---

**Analysis Process (Executed Automatically):**  

**1. Function-CDFG Mapping**  
For each function in the code:  
- Identify critical nodes (e.g., branches with data-dependent conditions)  
- Map CDFG edges to corresponding code segments  

**2. Infeasible Path Detection**  
Analyze each path in the CDFG considering:  
- **Data Dependencies:** Paths where variables have conflicting states  
- **Logical Constraints:** Mutually exclusive conditions (e.g., `(x > 0 && x < 0)`)  
- **Loop Invariants:** Paths that violate loop exit conditions  
- **Dead Code:** Unreachable blocks identified in the CDFG  

**3. Infeasibility Classification**  
Categorize each infeasible path as:  
- **Statically Infeasible:** Infeasible in all executions (e.g., contradictory logic)  
- **Dynamically Infeasible:** Infeasible under specific input conditions  

**4. Consolidated Report**  
Generate for each function:  
- List of infeasible paths with code location  
- Technical justification based on the CDFG  
- Impact on structural test coverage  
- Recommendations for CDFG/code refinement

**Expected Output Example:**  
```  
Function: calculate_grade  
- Infeasible Path #1: Nodes [A3→B5→C7]  
  Reason: Condition "score > 100 && score < 50" is logically impossible  
  Effect: Dead code detected in block C7  
- Infeasible Path #2: Nodes [A3→D9]  
  Reason: Variable 'initialized' must be false at A3 but true at D9  
```  

**Technical Note:** This analysis assumes the provided CDFG faithfully reflects the control and data flow. Detected infeasibilities may indicate optimization opportunities or a need for model revision.
