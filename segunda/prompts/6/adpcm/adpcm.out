**Control Flow Graph (CFG) and Data Flow Graph (DFG) Analysis for adpcm.c**

After analyzing the provided C code (`adpcm.c`) and constructing both the Control Flow Graph (CFG) and Data Flow Graph (DFG) using Graphviz, here are the findings:

### 1. **Control Flow Graph (CFG) Overview**
The CFG for `adpcm.c` is complex due to nested loops, conditionals, and multiple functions. Key functions like `encode`, `decode`, `my_sin`, `my_cos`, and `main` contribute to the graph's structure. The CFG highlights:
- **Loops**: Fixed-count loops (e.g., `for (i = 0; i < 10; i++)` in `encode`) and conditional loops (e.g., `while (my_fabs(diff) >= 1)` in `my_sin`).
- **Conditionals**: Branches based on comparisons (e.g., `if (el >= 0)` in `quantl`).
- **Function Calls**: Interactions between functions (e.g., `main` calls `encode`, `decode`, and `my_cos`).

### 2. **Data Flow Graph (DFG) Overview**
The DFG reveals data dependencies, such as:
- **Global Variables**: `tqmf`, `delay_bpl`, `delay_dltx`, etc., are shared across functions.
- **Dependencies**: For example, in `encode`, `dlt` depends on `detl` and `il`, which in turn depend on `el` and `xl`.
- **Integer Arithmetic**: Operations like `(long)detl * qq4_code4_table[il >> 2]` show data flow through multiplication and shifts.

### 3. **Infeasible Paths Analysis**
Based on the CFG and DFG, **no infeasible paths** were identified. Here's why:
- **No Logical Contradictions**: Conditions in sequences (e.g., in `quantl` or `logscl`) do not exhibit mutual exclusion (e.g., no `x > 10` followed by `x < 5` without intermediate changes).
- **Data Dependencies**: All variables are initialized before use (e.g., `reset()` initializes arrays and variables). No dead code or uninitialized variable accesses were found.
- **Loop Conditions**: Loop bounds are fixed or based on constants (e.g., `SIZE = 3`), ensuring all loops are feasible.
- **System Constraints**: The code uses no external resources (e.g., hardware/network) that could cause infeasibility.
- **Program Invariants**: Business rules (e.g., ADPCM encoding/decoding logic) are consistent and do not block any paths.

### 4. **Conclusion**
The code is well-structured, with no infeasible paths detected. All paths are executable under the given constraints and data dependencies.

**Final Answer: `0` infeasible paths.**
