Okay, I need to process this code according to the given instructions. Let me see what needs to be done.

First, remove comments. The code has block comments and inline comments. So I'll go through each line and delete any comment lines or parts of lines that are comments.

Looking at the first part:
int fib(int n)
{
  int  i, Fnew, Fold, temp,ans;

    Fnew = 1;  Fold = 0;
    for ( i = 2;
	  i <= 30 && i <= n;          /* apsim_loop 1 0 */
	  i++ )
I see a block comment here. I'll remove the comment line.

Next, in main(), there's no comments except maybe inline ones, but looking at it, it seems there are none after processing.

Second step: Remove redundant whitespace and excess blank lines. The code has multiple spaces and some empty lines. For example, between Fnew =1; Fold=0; and the for loop, there's a line with only /*...*/ which I removed. Now, in the cleaned code, I need to ensure that each statement is on its own line without unnecessary spaces.

Looking at variable declarations, they have multiple spaces after commas. I'll correct that by making it one space or removing extra.

For example:
int  i, Fnew, Fold, temp,ans;
The double space between int and i becomes single.

Also, in the for loop condition, there's a lot of whitespace around &&. I'll reduce it to just one space on each side if necessary, but maybe even no space since it's an operator.

Third step: Preserve code structure, so I won't change function declarations, control structures like if/for/while, expressions, assignments, or function calls.

Fourth step: Maintain original indentation for readability. So the structure should stay as is, just cleaned up in terms of comments and whitespace.

Putting it all together:

- Remove all comment lines.
- Clean up variable declarations by removing extra spaces between variables.
- Ensure each statement is on its own line without unnecessary empty lines in between.
- Keep the functions and control structures intact with proper indentation.

Now, let's go through each part step by step.

Starting with the fib function:
Original code has comments inside the for loop. I'll remove those.

Then, in main(), after a=30; there's a call to fib(a); followed by return a;. That seems okay.

Wait, looking at the original code again:

In the fib function, after the declarations, Fnew and Fold are assigned on the same line but separated by spaces. I'll leave that as is because it's part of the expression.

Also, in the for loop initialization, there's i=2; Then inside, i increments correctly.

So, processing each line:

1. int fib(int n) { ... } remains.
2. Remove comments from lines like /* apsim_loop 1 0 */.
3. Ensure that between statements, only necessary whitespace is kept. For example, in the for loop's condition part, remove extra spaces around &&.

So after processing, the code should look clean without any comments and minimal whitespace.

I think I've covered all steps now. Let me write out the cleaned code accordingly.
