Okay, I need to create a CDFG for the given C code function 'main'. Let me first understand what the code does.

Looking at the main function:
- It declares an integer variable 'a'.
- Assigns 30 to 'a'.
- Calls fib(a).
- Returns 'a'.

The fib function is another part of the code, but since the task is about the 'main' function, I'll focus on that.

So, breaking down main():
1. Line 1: int a; → declares variable a.
2. Line 2: a = 30; → assigns value to a.
3. Line 3: fib(a); → calls fib with a's value (30).
4. Line 4: return a; → returns the value of a.

For CDFG, I need to represent each basic block as nodes and control/data flows as edges.

Each node will have:
- A label representing the code in that block.
- Definitions (def) of variables created there.
- Uses (use) of variables.

Let's identify each part:

Node 1: int a; → declares 'a' but doesn't define it yet. So, no def here, just a declaration. But in terms of CDFG, I think the variable is used later, so maybe this node has uses for 'a'.

Wait, actually, the assignment to 'a' happens in line 2. So perhaps each statement is a separate node.

But let's consider the structure:

1. Declaration of a: int a;
   - This is just a declaration; no def yet.
   - Uses? Not until it's assigned or used elsewhere.

2. a = 30;
   - Assigns value to 'a'. So, this node defines 'a'.
   - Also uses the constant 30 and assigns to 'a'.

3. fib(a);
   - Calls fib function with 'a' as argument.
   - Uses 'a' here.

4. return a;
   - Returns the value of 'a'.
   - Uses 'a'.

So, breaking into nodes:

Node 1: int a; → just declaration, maybe no def or use yet? Or perhaps it's considered a definition because the variable is being declared and used later.

Wait, in terms of data flow, variables are defined when they get values. So:

- Node 2 (a=30) defines 'a'.
- Node 3 uses 'a' as an argument.
- Node 4 uses 'a' again.

But what about the declaration? Maybe it's part of the initial setup but doesn't contribute to data flow except for initializing the variable. So perhaps node 1 just declares 'a', and then node 2 defines it.

Alternatively, each statement is a separate node:

Node 1: int a; → declaration (no def yet)
Node 2: a=30; → def of a
Node 3: fib(a); → use of a
Node 4: return a; → use of a

But in the example provided, nodes have both defs and uses. So I think each node can represent a statement that may have both.

So:

- Node 1 (int a;) has no def but may have a declaration. Not sure if it's part of data flow, as 'a' isn't used until later.

But in the context of CDFG, variables are defined when assigned. So perhaps node 2 is where 'a' is defined.

Wait, maybe I should model each statement as a node:

Node 1: int a; → just declaration (no def yet)
Node 2: a =30 → defines a
Node 3: fib(a) → uses a
Node 4: return a → uses a

But the problem is that in code, variables are declared before use. So node 1 declares 'a', but it's not until node 2 that it's defined.

Hmm, perhaps each statement is a separate block. Let me structure the nodes accordingly.

Nodes:

1. int a; → declares variable a. No def yet.
   - Uses: None
   - Defs: None (but declaration)
2. a =30; → defines a=30
   - Uses: 30 (constant), assigns to a.
3. fib(a); → uses a as argument.
4. return a; → uses a.

But the first line 'int a;' doesn't do anything except declare, so in terms of data flow, perhaps it's not part of the graph because there are no def or use here except for possible future assignments.

Alternatively, maybe all lines are nodes, including declarations.

So each line is a node:

Node 1: int a;
Node 2: a =30;
Node 3: fib(a);
Node4: return a;

Now, for each node:

- Node 1:
   - Defs: none (a is declared but not defined)
   - Uses: none
- Node 2:
   - Defs: a=30
   - Uses: 30 (constant)
- Node3:
   - Uses: a
- Node4:
   - Uses: a

So the control flow is sequential:

1 → 2 →3→4.

Additionally, in terms of data flow:

From node2 to node3 and node4, because 'a' is used there.

Now, considering CDFG construction:

Each node represents a basic block. Here, each statement is a single line, so each is a separate node.

Edges for control flow: 1→2→3→4.

For data flow:

- Node2 defines 'a', which is used in node3 and node4.

So edges from node2 to node3 (def-use) and node2 to node4 (def-use).

In the example provided, such def-use chains are represented as edges between nodes.

Additionally, for control flow, each node flows to the next unless there's a condition. But here it's sequential.

So in the CDFG:

Nodes 1-4 connected by control edges.

Also, data edges from node2 to node3 and node2 to node4.

But wait, what about node1? It declares 'a', but doesn't define it until node2. So perhaps node1 has a def for 'a'? Or is it just a declaration without a value?

In CDFG, variables are defined when assigned values. So the declaration (node1) doesn't contribute to data flow unless it's initialized. Therefore, node2 defines 'a', which is used in nodes3 and 4.

So, the nodes:

Node 1: int a; → no def or use
Node2: a=30; → def a=30
Node3: fib(a); → c-use of a
Node4: return a; → c-use of a

Wait, but in node3 and node4, 'a' is used. So the edges are control flow from 1→2→3→4, plus data edges (def-use) from node2 to 3 and 4.

Now, let's think about how this translates into Graphviz:

Each node will be a box, with label showing the code line. Also, in the xlabel or as part of the label, we can show defs and uses.

For example, node1 has no def/uses, so just the code.

Node2: defines 'a', uses 30.

So in the graph:

node [shape=box];

n1 [label="int a;"];
n2 [label="a = 30;", xlabel="Def: a; Use: 30"];
n3 [label="fib(a);", xlabel="C-Use: a; P-Use: none"];
n4 [label="return a;", xlabel="C-Use: a"];

Edges:

Control flow:
n1 -> n2;
n2 -> n3;
n3 -> n4;

Data flow (def-use):
n2 -> n3 [label="a"];
n2 -> n4 [label="a"];

But in the example provided, data edges are represented as edges between nodes with labels indicating the variable.

So putting it all together:

digraph main {
    rankdir=TB;
    node [shape=box];
    
    // Nodes
    n1 [label="int a;"];
    n2 [label="a = 30;", xlabel="Def: a\nUse: 30"];
    n3 [label="fib(a);", xlabel="C-Use: a"];
    n4 [label="return a;", xlabel="C-Use: a"];

    // Control Flow Edges
    n1 -> n2;
    n2 -> n3;
    n3 -> n4;

    // Data Flow Edges (def-use)
    n2 -> n3 [label="a"];
    n2 -> n4 [label="a"];
}

Wait, but in the example provided, data edges are shown as separate edges. So perhaps each def-use is represented by an edge from the node where it's defined to where it's used.

Alternatively, maybe for each use of a variable, there's a chain starting from its definition.

In this case, 'a' is defined once in n2 and used twice: in n3 and n4. So edges from n2→n3 (with label "a") and n2→n4 (label "a").

Now, the CDFG will have both control and data flow edges.

But wait, for the fib function call, does it create any def-use chains beyond 'a'? Since fib is a different function, perhaps in this main function's CDFG, we don't include the internal workings of fib. So only focus on 'a' being passed to fib but not tracking inside fib.

So the data flow for 'main' would be as described.

Additionally, let's think about possible test coverage criteria:

- All-Nodes: each node (n1, n2, n3, n4) must be visited by tests. But in this case, since it's a simple function, any test that runs main will hit all nodes.

- All-Edges: control and data edges. For example, the path where 'a' is assigned and then passed to fib and returned should cover all edges.

But perhaps for more complex code with branches, there would be more paths, but in this case, it's straightforward.

So the final CDFG includes four nodes connected by control flow, plus data edges from n2 to n3 and n4.
