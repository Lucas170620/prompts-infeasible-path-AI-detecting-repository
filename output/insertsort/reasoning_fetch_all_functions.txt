Alright, I need to analyze the provided C code and extract all user-defined functions or methods. The rules specify that I should list each function name on a new line without any additional formatting, preserving their original case.

Looking at the code, I see that it's an insertion sort implementation. The main function is named 'main', which is a standard entry point for C programs. 

I also notice some conditional compilation directives using #ifdef DEBUG, but those don't affect the extraction of function names because they're part of the same code block.

Checking the code, there are no other functions defined besides 'main'. The variables and loops within the main function aren't considered functions on their own.

So, the only user-defined function here is 'main'.
