Okay, I need to generate a Control and Data Flow Graph (CDFG) for the function `lms_log` using Graphviz DOT. The user has provided specific instructions on how to structure this graph, including details about nodes, edges, and labels.

First, I'll look at the code of `lms_log`. It's a simple function that takes a float `r` and returns 4.5f. Here's the function:

```c
static float lms_log(r)
float r;
{
  return 4.5;
}
```

This function doesn't have any control flow statements like if, for, while loopsâ€”it's just a single return statement.

Now, I need to construct the CDFG according to the specifications. Since there are no control structures, the graph will be straightforward. It should consist of a single node representing the function body.

Each node in the graph must show definitions (def) and usages (c-use and p-use). In this case, the function doesn't use any variables because it's just returning a constant value. So, there are no c-uses or p-uses.

The output should be in two parts: the DOT code for the graph and a mapping of code to nodes.

For the DOT code:

1. Define a directed graph with `digraph`.
2. Set `rankdir=TB` for vertical layout.
3. Create a single node labeled appropriately, showing that it defines the return value but has no usages since there are no variables involved.

The node will have:
- Label indicating it's the start and end of the function.
- No definitions or uses because it's just returning a constant.

So, the DOT code would be simple, with one node and no edges since there's only one basic block.

For the code-to-node mapping:

Each line of the function corresponds to this single node. Since the entire function is one statement, I'll map all lines to Node 1.

Finally, I need to ensure that the output follows the required format: first the DOT code in a `digraph` block, then the code-to-node mappings within `<codigos - NomeFuncao>` tags.
