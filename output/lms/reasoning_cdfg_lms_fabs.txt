Okay, I need to generate a precise Control and Data Flow Graph (CDFG) in Graphviz DOT format for the function `lms_fabs`. Let me start by understanding what this function does.

Looking at the code, `lms_fabs` takes a float `n` as input. The function checks if `n` is non-negative. If it is, `f` is set to `n`; otherwise, `f` is `-n`. Then, it returns `f`.

So, the function has two main branches based on the condition of `n`. 

First, I'll break down the function into basic blocks and identify all definitions (def) and uses (c-use/p-use). 

1. The function starts with a check: if `n >= 0`, then execute one block; else, another.
2. Each branch has a definition for `f` based on the condition.

I need to represent each statement as nodes in the graph. For control flow, I'll have edges representing true and false paths. 

The first node (1) represents the function entry point, where `n` is taken as input. The next nodes will be the condition check (node 2), followed by the true branch (nodes 3-4) and false branch (nodes 5). Finally, the return statement is in node 6.

Each node must include its definitions and uses. For example:
- Node 1: Uses `n` to compute the condition.
- Nodes 3 and 5 define `f`.

Now, I'll map each code snippet to its corresponding node as per the required output format.

I need to ensure that nodes are correctly numbered and edges represent control flow with appropriate labels. The final graph should have a vertical layout with `rankdir=TB`.

Putting it all together, the CDFG will show how data flows through the function and how control structures direct the execution.
