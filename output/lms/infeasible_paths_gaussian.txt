The function `gaussian` aims to generate random numbers following a Gaussian distribution using the Box-Muller transform. However, upon analysis, an error was identified in how the scaling factor (`fac`) is calculated. Instead of using the logarithm of `r`, a hardcoded value (1.762) is used, leading to incorrect scaling and thus invalid Gaussian values. Despite this bug, all control flow paths are feasible as they correctly handle variable dependencies and function termination.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Function Overview:** The function uses static variables `ready`, `gstore`, and `gaus` to store state across calls.
2. **Initial Call (ready=0):**
   - Generates two uniform random numbers (`v1`, `v2`) and computes their squared sum `r`.
   - Repeats until `r <= 1`.
   - Incorrectly calculates `fac` using a hardcoded value instead of `r`.
3. **Control Flow:** All paths correctly handle variable assignments and function returns without logical inconsistencies.
4. **Bug Identification:** The calculation of `fac` is incorrect, affecting the Gaussian number generation but not causing infeasible paths.

**Answer:**

There are no infeasible control flow paths due to proper handling of variables and function termination. However, a bug exists in the scaling factor calculation (`fac`) which affects the correctness of the generated Gaussian numbers.

\boxed{\text{No infeasible paths detected; however, a functional bug exists.}}
