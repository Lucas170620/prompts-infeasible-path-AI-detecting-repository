**Analysis Report: Infeasible Paths in Code**

---

**Function: main**
- **Infeasible Path #1**: Nodes where mu is calculated as mu / (N - 1).
  - **Reason**: If N = 1, this results in a division by zero, which is logically impossible.
  - **Impact**: This path cannot be executed without causing runtime errors.

---

**Function: lms**
- **No Infeasible Paths Identified**:
  - The CDFG shows sequential operations without logical contradictions or impossible states.

---

**Other Functions (e.g., `lms_call`, `sin`, `gaussian`)**:
- Insufficient information provided to identify infeasible paths. Further analysis of their code and CDFGs would be required for a comprehensive assessment.

---

**Conclusion**: The primary infeasible path identified is in the `main` function due to division by zero when N = 1. This necessitates adding checks or constraints on N to prevent such errors, thereby improving test coverage and robustness of the code.
