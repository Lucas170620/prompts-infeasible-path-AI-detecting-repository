Alright, so I need to figure out how to extract all the user-defined function names from the given C code. Let's start by looking through the code step by step.

First, I'll read through the entire code to get an overview. The code seems to be related to CRC calculations, as indicated by the comments and variable names like 'icrc1' and 'icrc'. 

Looking at the functions:

1. There's a function named `LOBYTE` defined with `#define`. Wait, no—actually, that's a macro, not a function. So I should ignore it.

2. The first real function is `unsigned short icrc1(unsigned short crc, unsigned char onech)`. That's definitely a user-defined function. So I'll note that down: `icrc1`.

3. Next, there's another function `unsigned short icrc(unsigned short crc, unsigned long len, short jinit, int jrev)`. This is also a user-defined function—so add `icrc` to the list.

4. Then comes the `main` function, which is standard in C programs. So I'll include `main`.

I should check if there are any other functions or loops that might contain function definitions. Let me scan through the code again:

- The `icrc` function calls `icrc1`, but since we're only looking for top-level function declarations, not internal calls, that's fine.
- There are static arrays and variables inside `icrc`, but no additional function declarations there.

I also notice that `main` is defined as `int main(void)`, which is a standard entry point. So it's definitely a user-defined function.

So, compiling all the user-defined functions I've found:

- icrc1
- icrc
- main

Wait, did I miss any? Let me check once more.

Looking for any function definitions using `function_name(parameters)` structure. The code has three: `icrc1`, `icrc`, and `main`. No other functions are declared or defined within the given code snippet.

Therefore, the list should include these three functions.
