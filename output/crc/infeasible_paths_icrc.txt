To solve this problem, we need to identify infeasible paths within a given function based on logical contradictions or data dependencies. Specifically, we focus on whether all possible combinations of input parameters lead to valid execution without any undefined behaviors.

### Approach
The approach involves analyzing the control flow and variable initialization within the function. We look for scenarios where variables might be uninitialized or used in ways that violate their intended use. This analysis helps us identify paths that cannot be executed correctly due to logical inconsistencies or data issues.

### Solution Code

```python
def find_infeasible_paths():
    # The code provided is in C, but we'll analyze it conceptually.
    # We are looking for paths where cword remains uninitialized.
    
    # Scenario:
    # When both jinit < 0 and jrev >= 0, cword is not initialized,
    # leading to undefined behavior. This path is infeasible because
    # it causes a runtime error due to an uninitialized variable.

    return "Path where jinit < 0 and jrev >= 0 leads to uninitialized cword."

# To use this analysis, you would integrate it into your static code analysis tool or perform manual checks.
```

### Explanation
1. **Problem Analysis**: The function `icrc` initializes a local variable `cword` based on the parameters `jinit` and `jrev`. If neither condition (`jinit >= 0` nor `jrev < 0`) is met, `cword` remains uninitialized.

2. **Infeasible Path Identification**: When both `jinit` is negative and `jrev` is non-negative, `cword` is not assigned any value. Using an uninitialized variable in subsequent code leads to undefined behavior, making this path infeasible.

3. **Solution Approach**: The solution involves recognizing that certain combinations of input parameters can lead to variables being left uninitialized. This requires checking all possible parameter combinations and ensuring all paths within the function correctly initialize necessary variables.

By identifying such scenarios, we ensure the function behaves correctly for all valid inputs and avoids runtime errors due to undefined variable usage.
