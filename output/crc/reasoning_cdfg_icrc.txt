Okay, I need to generate a precise CDFG (Control and Data Flow Graph) for the function `icrc` using Graphviz DOT format. The user has provided specific instructions on how to structure this graph, so I'll follow them carefully.

First, I should understand the code of the `icrc` function. Let me read through it:

The function starts with a static declaration of `icrctb`, `init`, and `rchr`. It also declares some variables like `tmp1`, `tmp2`, `j`, and `cword`. There are several steps inside the function, including initializing arrays, handling parameters, and loops.

I need to break down the function into its basic blocks. Each block is a sequence of instructions with no branches or jumps except at the beginning or end. So I'll identify where these blocks start and end based on control flow structures like if statements, for loops, etc.

Looking at the code:

1. The function begins by checking if `init` is false. If so, it initializes `icrctb`, `init`, and `rchr`.
2. Then, it handles the `jinit` parameter to set `cword`. Depending on whether `jrev` is positive or negative, it sets `cword` differently.
3. There's a loop from `j=1` to `len`. Inside this loop, there are conditional checks based on `jrev`, and updates to `tmp1` and `cword`.
4. After the loop, depending on `jrev`, it computes `tmp2` either directly or through another transformation.
5. Finally, it returns `tmp2`.

Now, I'll list out each basic block:

- Block 0: Function entry and initialization check.
- Block 1: Inside the if (!init) condition.
- Block 2: Handling jinit >= 0 to set cword.
- Block 3: Else if (jrev < 0) handling.
- Block 4: The for loop structure, which includes:
   - Entry condition check.
   - Body of the loop with conditional assignments and operations.
- Block 5: After the loop, checking jrev >=0 or not to compute tmp2.

Next, I need to map each node in the graph. Each node represents a basic block. I'll number them sequentially as they appear in the code.

For each node, I have to note:
- The label (the code snippet)
- xlabel with def and use information.

I'll go through each part of the function step by step:

1. **Initialization Block**: This is where `init` is checked and the static variables are initialized if necessary. Here, `j`, `icrctb`, `rchr`, `it`, etc., are used or defined.

2. **Setting cword**: Depending on `jinit` and `jrev`, different assignments happen. These involve using parameters like `crc`, `len`, `jinit`, `jrev`.

3. **Loop Structure**: The for loop is a key part. It has an entry condition (j <= len), and inside, it processes each character in the string.

Now, considering data flow:

- Definitions (def) occur when variables are assigned new values.
- Uses (use) happen when variables are read but not written to immediately.

Each node will have labels indicating defs and uses for C-use and P-use where applicable. For example, in the loop body, `lin[j]` is accessed as a use, and `cword` is modified multiple times.

Edges between nodes represent control flow, with conditions labeled appropriately. For instance, after initializing, there's an edge leading into the processing of `jinit`.

I also need to ensure that the graph starts at node 1 (function entry) and ends with a double circle for the return statement.

Finally, I'll structure the DOT code with nodes numbered sequentially, edges showing control flow with conditions, and labels indicating data usage. The shape for most nodes will be 'circle', except the start and end which might have different shapes.
