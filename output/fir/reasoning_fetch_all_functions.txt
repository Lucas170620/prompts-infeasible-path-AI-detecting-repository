Okay, so I need to analyze the given C code and extract all the user-defined functions or methods. The user has provided a piece of code, and my task is to list only the names of these functions, following specific formatting rules.

First, I'll start by reading through the code carefully. I know that in C, functions are defined using the 'void' keyword followed by the function name and parameters in parentheses. Sometimes functions can also be declared with different return types like 'int', 'long', etc.

Looking at the provided code, I see a main function. That's definitely one function to note down: main(). 

Next, there's another function called fir_filter_int, which is defined after the main function. The parameters and body aren't important for this task; what matters is its name. So, that's another function: fir_filter_int().

Wait, in the code, I also notice a comment mentioning a function 'fir_filter_int' with specific parameters, but it's already defined later. So, no need to count that as a separate declaration.

Are there any other functions? Let me scan through again. There are some macros like #define OUTSIZE 720, which aren't functions. The code includes comments and variable declarations, but those don't constitute function definitions.

I should also check if the main function is properly named. Yes, it's int main(), so that's correct.

So, in total, I have two functions: main() and fir_filter_int(). 

Wait a minute, looking back at the code, I see that inside the main function, they call another function called fir_filter_int. But since this function is defined later in the code, it's only declared once as fir_filter_int(). So no duplicates here.

I think that's all. There are no other functions in the provided code snippet.
