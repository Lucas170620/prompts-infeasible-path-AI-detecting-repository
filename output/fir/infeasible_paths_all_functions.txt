Based on the analysis of the provided code and its Control Data Flow Graph (CDFG), no infeasible paths were identified that violate logical constraints or data dependencies under all possible execution scenarios. Here's a summary of the findings:

### Analysis of Infeasible Paths

1. **Function `main`:**
   - The function calls `fir_filter_int` with valid arguments and returns 0. There are no conditional branches, so all paths are feasible.

2. **Function `fir_filter_int`:**
   - **Node 2 (Loop Initialization):** The loop runs based on `i < in_len`. If `in_len` is non-negative, the loop behaves as expected.
   - **Node 5 (Inner Loop):** The inner loop uses `acc_length` to control iterations. As long as `acc_length` is a positive integer, no issues arise.
   - **Nodes 6-9 (Pointer Adjustments):** These nodes handle pointer adjustments based on conditions. While edge cases might affect performance, they don't create logical contradictions.

### Conclusion

No infeasible paths were detected in either function under the provided analysis. All control flows respect logical conditions and data dependencies without violating any constraints.
