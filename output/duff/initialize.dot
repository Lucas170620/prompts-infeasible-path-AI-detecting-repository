The hybrid Control Flow Graph (CFG) for the given code combines both control flow and data flow information. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the graph:

1. **Node 1:** Represents the declaration of `int i;`.
   - Shape: Box
   - xlabel: Def: i

2. **Node 2:** Represents the start of the for loop, including initialization (`i=0`), condition check (`i < length`), and increment (`i++`).
   - Shape: Diamond (Decision)
   -xlabel: Use: length (P-Use in condition), i (C-Use in assignment and condition); Def: i
   - Edges:
     - To Node 3 if `i < length` is true.
     - To Exit node (Node4) if false.

3. **Node 3:** Represents the loop body where `arr[i]` is assigned the value `length - i`.
   - Shape: Box
   -xlabel: Use: arr (address), length, i; Def: arr[i]
   - Edge:
     - Back to Node2 for the next iteration.

4. **Node 4:** Represents the exit node.
   - Shape: Doublecircle

### Edges:

- **Edge from Node1 to Node2:** Entry into the loop initialization.
- **Edge from Node2 to Node3 (labeled "i < length"):** Control flows into the loop body if the condition is true.
- **Edge from Node2 to Node4 (labeled "!i < length"):** Exits the function when the loop condition fails.
- **Edge from Node3 back to Node2:** After executing the loop body, control returns to check the condition again.

This graph effectively captures both the flow of execution and the data dependencies within each node.
