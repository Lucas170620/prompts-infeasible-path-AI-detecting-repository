Okay, I need to generate a precise hybrid Control and Data Flow Graph (CDFG) in Graphviz DOT format for the `main` function provided in the given C code. The user has specified detailed requirements, so I should carefully follow each step.

First, let me understand the structure of the code. The main function does the following:

1. Initializes an array called `source` with values from 0 to ARRAYSIZE-1.
2. Calls `duffcopy` with `source`, `target`, and `INVOCATION_COUNT`.

Looking at the `duffcopy` function, it's implementing Duff's Device, which is a way to unroll loops using switch statements. The function copies data from `from` to `to` in chunks determined by `count % 8`. It calculates `n` as `(count +7)/8`, which determines how many times the loop body will execute.

So, for each invocation of `duffcopy`, it processes a certain number of elements based on `n`, and the switch statement handles cases from 0 to 7, each corresponding to a different offset in bytes. The loop continues until `n` becomes zero.

Now, I need to construct the CDFG for `main`. Let's break down the steps:

1. **Identify Basic Blocks:**
   - The main function has three basic blocks:
     - Block 1: Call to `initialize`.
     - Block 2: Call to `duffcopy`.
     - Block 3: End of main.

2. **Flow Control Analysis:**
   - The flow is straightforward since there are no conditionals or loops in the main function itself. It's a linear sequence of function calls.

3. **Data Flow Analysis:**
   - Variables used:
     - `source` and `target` are initialized and passed to functions.
     - `INVOCATION_COUNT` is a constant, so it's only defined once.
   - Functions called modify these variables internally, but for the main function, we need to track how they're used.

4. **Nodes Representation:**
   - Each node represents a basic block or operation.
   - Nodes should show both control flow and data usage.

5. **Graph Construction:**
   - Start with the beginning of `main`.
   - Follow with the calls to `initialize` and `duffcopy`.
   - End with the return from `main`.

6. **Edge Labeling:**
   - Since there are no conditionals, edges will simply represent sequential execution.

7. **Node Labels:**
   - Include both control flow (like function calls) and data usage (variables read/written).

Putting this together, I'll define each node with appropriate labels and connect them in sequence. The graph should be a simple linear chain from the start to the end of `main`.

I need to make sure that all nodes are correctly numbered and labeled, showing their definitions and uses as per the requirements.
