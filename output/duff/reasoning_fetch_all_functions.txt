Alright, so I need to analyze the given code and extract all the user-defined functions. Let me start by reading through the code carefully.

The code begins with some comments about a benchmark created by Jakob Engblom. Then there are several defines: ARRAYSIZE set to 100 and INVOCATION_COUNT set to 43. These are just constants, so I can ignore them for function extraction.

Next, I see the function duffcopy. It's defined as void duffcopy(char *to, char *from, int count). So that's one function.

Then there's another function called initialize. Its signature is void initialize(char *arr, int length). That's the second function.

After that, there are two arrays declared: source and target, both of type char with size ARRAYSIZE. These are just variables, not functions, so I skip them.

Finally, there's the main function. It's defined as void main(void). So that's the third function.

I should check if there are any other functions or if I missed something. Looking through the code again, I don't see any other function definitions. The switch statement inside duffcopy isn't a function; it's just part of the loop structure.

So, the three functions I found are duffcopy, initialize, and main.
