Okay, so I need to analyze the given code and extract only the names of all user-defined functions or methods. I should ignore any built-in or library functions. The output should list each function name on a new line, preserving their case, and include all functions including main.

Looking at the provided code:

The first part is a function named fib. It's defined with int fib(int n) { ... }, so that's one function.

Then there's the main function: int main() { ... }, which is another function.

I should make sure I'm not missing any other functions. The code doesn't seem to have any others; it's just fib and main.

So, the list of function names should include both fib and main.
