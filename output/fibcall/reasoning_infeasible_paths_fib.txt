Alright, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze the given code and its CFG to identify any infeasible paths. Let's take it step by step.

First, looking at the code provided:

The function `fib(int n)` computes the Fibonacci sequence using a loop that runs from `i=2` up to either 30 or `n`, whichever is smaller. The variables `Fnew` and `Fold` are initialized to 1 and 0 respectively. Inside the loop, `temp` is assigned the value of `Fnew`, then `Fnew` becomes the sum of `Fnew` and `Fold`, and finally `Fold` takes the old value of `Fnew` (stored in `temp`). After the loop, `ans` is set to `Fnew` and returned.

In `main()`, the variable `a` is set to 30, and then `fib(a)` is called. The function returns `a`, which is 30.

Now, looking at the CDFG provided:

The nodes are structured as follows:
1. Node 1 initializes `Fnew` and `Fold`.
2. Node 2 checks if `i <= 30 && i <= n`. If true, it goes to Node 3; else, to Node 7.
3. Nodes 3-5 handle the loop body: assign `temp`, update `Fnew`, then `Fold`.
4. After the loop ends (Node 7), `ans` is assigned and returned.

I need to analyze this for infeasible paths.

Starting with Passo 1: Mapping code to CDFG nodes.

- Node 1 corresponds to the initialization of `Fnew` and `Fold` outside the loop.
- Node 2 is the loop condition check on line 4 (for the for-loop).
- Nodes 3,4,5 are inside the loop body. Line 6 assigns `temp = Fnew`, line 7 updates `Fnew += Fold`, and line 8 sets `Fold = temp`.
- After the loop, Node 7 assigns `ans = Fnew` (line 9), and Node 8 returns `ans`.

Passo 2: Identifying potential paths.

Possible paths would be any sequence starting from Node 1 through the loop body multiple times until the condition in Node 2 fails, then proceeding to Nodes 7 and 8.

Passo 3: Classify as statically or dynamically infeasible.

I need to check each possible path for contradictions.

Looking at the code:

The loop runs while `i <=30` and `i <=n`. Since `n` is passed as 30 from `main()`, the condition becomes `i <=30 && i<=30`, which simplifies to just `i <=30`.

So, the loop will run for `i=2` up to `i=30`.

But wait, let's check how many times the loop runs. Since `n` is 30, each iteration increments `i` by 1 until `i` exceeds 30.

Each iteration updates `Fnew` and `Fold`, correctly computing Fibonacci numbers.

Potential infeasible paths would involve conditions that can't be met. Let's consider possible branches:

- Node 2: The loop condition is `i <=30 && i <=n`. Since `n=30`, this is always true for each iteration until `i` reaches 31, which exits the loop.

Is there any path where the loop doesn't execute? Only if `n < 2`, but since `a` is set to 30 in `main()`, and the function is called with that value, the loop will definitely run from `i=2` to `i=30`.

But what about when the loop condition becomes false? Once `i` exceeds 30, it exits. But since `n` is 30, after the last iteration (`i=30`), `i` increments to 31 and exits.

So all paths through Node 2 will eventually reach a point where the condition fails, leading to Nodes 7 and 8.

But let's look for specific infeasible paths. Are there any branches that can't be taken?

For example, is there a path where after exiting the loop, `ans` isn't assigned? No, because Node 7 always assigns `ans = Fnew`, regardless of how many times the loop ran.

Another point: Could the loop run zero times? That would happen if `i=2 >30`, which it's not in this case. But since `n=30`, and `i` starts at 2, the loop will definitely run at least for `i=2`.

Wait a second—actually, no. The condition is checked each time before entering the loop. So if `n < 2`, the loop wouldn't execute even once. But in this case, since `a=30` and thus `n=30`, the loop will run for `i=2` to `i=30`.

So all paths that go through the loop are feasible.

Are there any other possible infeasible paths? Let's consider:

- The path where Node 2 evaluates to false on the first check. That would only happen if `n < 2`, but since `n=30`, it's always true for `i=2`. So that path is dynamically impossible when `n >=2`.

Another angle: Data dependencies.

Are there any variables not properly initialized? Let's see:

`Fnew` and `Fold` are initialized before the loop. `temp` is assigned inside Node 3, which is part of the loop body. Since the loop runs at least once (for `i=2`), `temp` will always be initialized.

Wait, what if `n <2`, meaning the loop doesn't run? Then `ans = Fnew` would still be set to 1, but since `Fnew` and `Fold` are initialized outside. But in our case, `n=30`, so this isn't a concern.

Looking for data flow issues: In each iteration, `temp` is assigned `Fnew`'s value before it's updated. Then `Fnew` becomes `Fnew + Fold`, and `Fold` takes the old `Fnew`. So there are no data races or uninitialized variables used after their assignment in the same path.

Another point: Is the loop condition such that when `i=30`, the next increment makes it 31, which is beyond 30, so the loop exits correctly. No issues here.

So, looking for any paths where a condition leads to an impossible scenario.

For example, in Node 2, if both conditions were somehow contradictory, but since they're `&&` and both are checking against similar variables (`i <=30` and `i<=n`, with `n=30`), it's not a contradiction unless `i >30`.

But that only happens when the loop exits. So no infeasible paths due to logical contradictions within the same path.

Another possibility: If during some iteration, after updating `Fnew` and `Fold`, there's an impossible state, but since Fibonacci numbers are always positive and increasing, there shouldn't be any negative values or inconsistencies that would make subsequent conditions impossible.

Wait, in the given code, is there a point where an inconsistency could occur?

Looking at the loop:

- `temp = Fnew;` (Node 3)
- `Fnew += Fold;` (Node4)
- `Fold = temp;` (Node5)

This correctly computes the next Fibonacci number. So no data inconsistencies here.

After the loop, `ans` is set to `Fnew`, which after running from i=2 to 30 will be Fib(31), but that's beyond our current scope—it's just a computation.

So, considering all this, are there any infeasible paths?

It seems like every possible path through the code is feasible under the given conditions. Since `n` is set to 30, which is within the loop condition's limit of 30, the loop runs correctly without any contradictions or data issues.

Wait a minute—what about when `i=30`, after processing, it increments to 31 and exits the loop. That's expected behavior, so no infeasible path there.

I'm struggling to find any path that's impossible. All paths either go through the loop until `i` exceeds 30 or exit early if `n < i`. But since `n=30`, it always goes through the loop at least once and exits after `i=31`.

Therefore, I don't see any infeasible paths in this code.
