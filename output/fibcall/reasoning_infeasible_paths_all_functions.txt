Okay, so I have this problem where I need to analyze the given code for any infeasible paths using its Control Flow and Data Flow Graph (CDFG). The code provided includes a `fib` function and a `main` function. Let me start by understanding each part step by step.

First, looking at the `fib` function:

The function initializes two variables, Fnew and Fold, to 1 and 0 respectively. Then it enters a loop where it iterates from i=2 up to either 30 or n, whichever is smaller. In each iteration, it calculates new values for Fnew and Fold based on the previous values. After the loop, it returns Fnew as the result.

Now, considering the CDFG for `fib`, there are nodes representing the initializations, the loop condition checks, and the operations inside the loop. The loop continues until i exceeds 30 or n. 

For infeasible paths analysis, I need to check if any path through this function is logically impossible. Let's think about the loop conditions. Since `i` starts at 2 and increments by 1 each time, it will stop when `i > 30` or `i > n`. If n is less than 2, say n=1, the condition `i <=n` would be false on the first iteration (since i starts at 2). So, for n < 2, the loop doesn't execute. But wait, in Fibonacci sequence, fib(0) is 0 and fib(1) is 1, but this function's base cases are Fnew=1 and Fold=0 initially.

Wait, perhaps when n is less than 2, the code might not compute correctly because the initial values are set before the loop. So for n=1, the loop doesn't run, and it returns Fnew which is 1. But according to Fibonacci, fib(1) should be 1, so that's correct.

Now, looking at the loop condition `i <=30 && i <=n`. The order matters because of short-circuit evaluation. If n is less than or equal to 30, then the first part `i <=30` will determine the outcome only if it's false; otherwise, it checks `i <=n`. So for example, if n=15, the loop runs up to i=15 because the second condition takes precedence.

But is there any infeasible path here? Let me think about possible values of i. Since i starts at 2 and increments by 1 each time, it can't skip any integers between 2 and the maximum allowed value (30 or n). So all iterations are sequential and necessary for building up Fnew correctly.

Wait, what if n is negative? Because in the loop condition, if n is a very small number, say -5, then `i <=n` becomes false immediately since i starts at 2. But looking back, in the main function, a=30 is passed to fib(a). So for this specific case, n=30, which is within the loop's upper limit of 30.

So considering the given code where a=30 is passed to fib, the loop will run from i=2 up to 30. Each step correctly updates Fnew and Fold without any contradictions.

Now, checking for infeasible paths, are there any conditions that can't be met? For instance, if during the loop execution, Fnew could somehow become negative, but since we're adding Fold (which is always less than or equal to Fnew), it remains positive. So all data flows seem valid.

In the CDFG for `fib`, the only paths are through the loop as long as i doesn't exceed 30 or n. There's no conditional branch that can lead to a contradiction because once i exceeds either limit, the loop exits cleanly without any conflicts.

Looking at the `main` function: it sets a=30, calls fib(a), and returns a. Since fib(30) computes correctly, there are no issues here either.

Therefore, after analyzing both functions and their CDFGs, I don't find any infeasible paths because all control flows and data usages are logically consistent for the given input.
