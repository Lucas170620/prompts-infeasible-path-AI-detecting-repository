Okay, so I need to analyze the provided code and its CDFG to identify any infeasible paths. Let me start by understanding what's given.

The code is a function called fac(int n) which calculates the factorial of n recursively. Then there's the main() function that loops from 0 to n, summing up the factorials.

Looking at the CDFG, it has nodes labeled from 1 to 5 with various conditions and uses. My first step is to map each node in the CDFG back to the corresponding lines of code.

Node 1 seems to be the start of the fac function. Node 2 checks if n == 0. If true, it goes to node 3 which returns 1. Otherwise, it goes to node 4 where it calls fac(n-1) and multiplies by n, then returns that in node 5.

Now, I need to list all possible paths through the CDFG. Since it's a recursive function, each call can branch based on whether n is zero or not. Let me think about the possible execution paths.

Starting from node 1, the first decision is at node 2 (n == 0). If true, return 1 via nodes 2->3. If false, proceed to node 4 and then 5.

Wait, but each call to fac() could potentially create a new path. For example, if n=5 in main(), the loop calls fac(0), fac(1), ..., fac(5). Each of these would be separate executions of the fac function with different n values.

So for each call to fac(i) where i ranges from 0 to 5, we have a recursive tree. For each instance, if n is 0, it's a base case; else, it calls itself recursively.

Now, I need to check each possible path in the CDFG across all these function invocations for any contradictions or impossible scenarios.

Let me take specific examples:

1. fac(0): n=0
   - Path: 1 ->2 (n==0 is true) ->3.
   - Returns 1, which is correct.

2. fac(1):
   - Path: 1->2 (false)->4->5.
   - Returns 1 * fac(0), which is 1*1=1.

3. fac(2):
   - Calls fac(1) which in turn calls fac(0).
   - Each step follows the same logic without any contradictions.

Wait, but I'm looking for paths that are logically impossible. So far, all the recursive steps seem valid because each step either returns 1 or multiplies by a lower n until it reaches zero.

Is there any situation where the conditions lead to an impossible path?

Looking at node 2's condition: if (n ==0). Since n is passed as an argument from main(), which loops i from 0 to n, and in each iteration calls fac(i), n can't be negative because i starts at 0. So for all function invocations, n >=0.

Wait a minute! What happens when n becomes negative during recursion? Because if someone calls fac(-1), that would cause an infinite loop or stack overflow. But in this main(), n is set to 5, so the maximum call is fac(5). Each recursive call subtracts 1 from n until it hits zero.

But wait, let's consider the function signature and possible inputs. The function is declared as int fac(int n), but if someone calls it with a negative number, that would cause problems because there's no base case for n <0. However, in this main(), i only goes up to 5, so all function calls are valid (n >=0).

Therefore, within the context of this specific program (main() setting n=5 and looping from 0), there are no invalid paths because n never becomes negative.

But wait, looking at node 4: it's labeled as P-Use: n and C-Use: n, Def: fac(n-1). So when n is zero, we don't enter this node; otherwise, we do. Since all calls in main() have n >=0, the else clause is only taken for n>=1.

So in each call, if n ==0: return 1. Else: return n * fac(n-1). All these paths are valid because once n reaches zero, it returns correctly without any issues.

Therefore, there are no infeasible paths in this code when considering the specific execution from main() where n=5 and i ranges from 0 to 5.

Wait, but what about if someone modifies the main function? For example, if main() called fac(-1), that would cause an infinite recursion. But in the given code, main() only calls it with i up to 5, which is safe.

So within this specific context, all paths are feasible because each recursive call reduces n by one and eventually hits zero without any contradictions.
