Okay, so I need to generate a CDFG for the given function 'fac' using Graphviz DOT notation. Let me start by understanding what the code does.

The function 'fac' is a recursive factorial function. It takes an integer n and returns 1 if n is 0; otherwise, it returns n multiplied by fac(n-1).

First, I'll identify all the basic blocks in this function. A basic block is a sequence of instructions with no jumps into or out of it except at the beginning and end.

Looking at 'fac':
1. The first line is an if statement: if (n == 0) return 1; else return n * fac(n-1);
So, there are two basic blocks here. One for when n == 0, which returns 1, and another for the else case which does the multiplication.

Now, mapping definitions and uses:
- The parameter 'n' is used in both the if condition and the else part.
- In the else block, 'fac(n-1)' uses 'n', so there's a definition of n-1 when it's called recursively.

Next, I need to construct the CDFG by integrating control flow and data flow. Each node represents either a basic block or a decision point. Edges represent possible paths with their conditions.

Starting with the entry node (node 1), which is the start of the function. Then, the if condition splits into two nodes: one for when n==0 (true path) leading to return 1, and another for the false path which computes the factorial recursively.

I'll number each node sequentially:
- Node 1: Entry point
- Node 2: Check if n == 0
- Node 3: Return 1 (true case)
- Node 4: Else clause (false case)
- Node 5: Compute and return n * fac(n-1)

Edge labels will have the conditions, like [label="n == 0"].

I also need to represent definitions and uses in each node's xlabel. For example, node 2 has a use of 'n' for the condition. Node 4 defines 'fac(n-1)' as it calls itself with n-1.

Finally, I'll structure this into a DOT file with nodes and edges, ensuring that loops are handled properly if any exist (though in this case, 'fac' is recursive without loops).

I think that's all the steps. Now, let me put it together in the required format.
