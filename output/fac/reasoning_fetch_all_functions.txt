Okay, so I need to analyze this C code and extract the names of all user-defined functions or methods. Let me look at the code carefully.

The code starts with some comments, but those can be ignored. Then there's a function declaration: int fac(int n). That's definitely a user-defined function. So 'fac' is one name to note down.

Next, in the main function, there are loops and variables being used, but the functions called within main are built-in or part of the standard library, like s += fac(i) which calls the fac function we already noted, not a new one. The for loop increments i and uses n as a variable, which is set to 5.

Then, there's another function in the code: int main(void). So 'main' is also a user-defined function, even though it's the entry point of the program.

I should make sure I'm not missing any other functions. The code doesn't declare any others besides fac and main. So the list would include both of these names.

Wait, are there any other functions? Let me check again. The only function declarations are fac and main. No other functions are defined within this scope. So yes, that's all.
