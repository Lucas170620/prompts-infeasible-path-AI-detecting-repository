Okay, so I need to analyze the given code and its CDFG to identify any infeasible paths. Let's start by understanding what uppol2 is supposed to do based on the provided code.

Looking at the code for uppol2, it seems to be manipulating some variables like wd2 and apl2. The function starts by initializing wd2 as 4 times al1. Then there are several condition checks involving plt, plt1, and plt2, which affect how wd2 is modified.

Now, looking at the CDFG provided in the dot file, I can see that it's a directed graph with nodes labeled from 1 to 9. Each node represents a part of the code. For example, Node 1 corresponds to the line where wd2 is set, and Nodes 2,5 are condition checks.

In the CDFG, the possible paths go through these nodes based on the conditions. The critical point here is to check each path for logical contradictions or data dependencies that might make a path impossible.

Starting with the first condition at Node 2: if (plt * plt1 >=0L). If this is true, then wd2 is negated at Node 3; otherwise, it's shifted right by 7 bits at Node4. Then, moving to Node5, another condition on (plt*plt2 >=0L), which decides whether to add 128 or subtract from wd2.

After these operations, apl2 is computed as (127 * al2) >>7 and then added to wd4. Finally, it checks if wd4 exceeds certain thresholds.

Now, I need to see if any of the paths lead to contradictions. For instance, suppose in a path where both conditions at Nodes 2 and5 are true: wd2 is negated and then 128 is added. But what's important here is whether these operations could result in impossible states based on the input variables.

Wait, but looking at the code, all the conditions are based on products of plt variables. Since the function doesn't have any initial constraints on plt, plt1, or plt2 beyond their declaration, it's possible for them to take any integer values. So, theoretically, both conditions could be true or false independently.

However, let's think about specific scenarios:

Path 1: Node2 is true (plt*plt1 >=0), so wd2 becomes -wd2. Then, at Node5, if plt*plt2 >=0, wd4 = wd2 +128. If both are true, then wd2 was just negated, and we're adding 128.

Is there any condition that would make this impossible? Not inherently. Unless the variables have some constraints not reflected in the code snippet provided.

Another Path: Node2 false (so wd2 is right-shifted by7), then at Node5 true, so wd4 = wd2 +128. Again, possible without contradiction.

Wait, but looking closer at how wd4 is handled after Node8:

At Node8, after calculating wd4 as either wd2+128 or wd2-128, it's added to apl2. Then, there are saturation checks: if wd4 exceeds 12288 or goes below -12288, it's clamped.

So in all cases, the function ensures that wd4 stays within these limits, but does that affect any path feasibility? Probably not because the operations are designed to handle those extremes.

Another angle is data dependencies. For example, if a variable isn't initialized before use. But looking at the code, al1 and al2 are used in calculations for wd2 and apl2 respectively, so I assume they're properly initialized elsewhere.

Wait, but what about plt variables? They could potentially be uninitialized. However, since the function doesn't declare them, it's likely that these are passed as parameters or defined earlier. So if they aren't properly handled, their values could lead to unexpected behavior, but that would be a runtime issue rather than an infeasible path.

So, considering all possible paths through the CDFG:

1. Node2 true → Node3 (wd2 = -wd2), then Node4 (shift right 7), then either Node6 or Node8 based on condition at Node5.
   - If both conditions are true, no contradiction arises as variables can take any values.

2. Node2 false → shift wd2 by7 bits, then depending on Node5's condition, add 128 or subtract.

Wait a second, but what about the combination where after shifting, we end up with a negative number and then in Node5 decide to add 128? That seems feasible.

I'm trying to find any logical contradictions. For example, if a path requires that certain conditions are met that can't coexist.

But looking at Nodes 2 and5, their conditions are independent because they check different products (plt*plt1 vs plt*plt2). So, for instance, if in one case plt*plt1 is positive but plt*plt2 is negative, the path would take both negation and subtraction. That's possible without any logical issues.

So, unless there's a situation where a variable must satisfy conflicting constraints based on different conditions, I don't see inherent contradictions in the paths.

Wait, another thought: What about if after certain operations, wd4 ends up outside the allowed range? But in the code, it's clamped to 12288 or -12288, so no. It won't cause any exceptions; it just gets capped.

Therefore, perhaps there are no infeasible paths because all possible execution paths through this function are logically consistent given the variables' possible values.

But wait, maybe if a certain combination of conditions leads to an impossible state based on how variables are used elsewhere in the program. For example, if another part of the code expects a specific value that can't be achieved here, but within the scope of uppol2 itself, all paths seem valid.

So, after considering all possible scenarios and the structure of the CDFG, I don't find any logical contradictions or impossible data dependencies within the function's own logic. All paths are feasible under appropriate input conditions.
