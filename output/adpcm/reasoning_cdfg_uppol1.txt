Okay, I need to generate a hybrid Control and Data Flow Graph (CDFG) in Graphviz DOT format for the function `uppol1`. Let me start by understanding what this function does.

Looking at the code of `uppol1`, it takes four parameters: al1, apl2, plt, and plt1. The function performs several operations:

1. It calculates `wd2` as `(al1 * 255L) >> 8L`. This is a bitwise right shift after multiplying by 255.
2. Then there's an if condition checking the sign of `(plt * plt1)`.
3. Depending on the condition, it sets `apl1` to either `wd2 + 192` or `wd2 - 192`.
4. Next, it calculates `wd3` as `15360 - apl2`.
5. Another if condition checks if `apl1` is greater than `wd3` or less than `-wd3`, and adjusts `apl1` accordingly.
6. Finally, it returns `apl1`.

Now, I need to break this down into basic blocks and map the data flow.

Starting with line 2: `long wd2 = ((long)al1 * 255L) >> 8L;`. This is one block, let's call it BB1. Here, al1 is read (C-use), and wd2 is defined.

Next, lines 3-4 are the condition `(plt * plt1 >=0L)`. So BB2 checks this condition. Variables plt and plt1 are C-used here.

Then, depending on the condition, either line 5 or 6 is executed. Let's call these BB3 (if true) and BB4 (if false). Both compute `apl1` based on `wd2`.

After that, lines 7-8 form another block, BB5, where `wd3` is calculated using apl2 (C-use).

Then, there are two if conditions for adjusting `apl1`. This can be split into BB6 and BB7, but since they're part of the same conditional chain, I'll need to represent them accordingly.

Finally, line 9 returns `apl1`, which is a definition.

I should now map each node in the CDFG:

- Node 1: WD2 calculation. Def: wd2; Use: al1.
- Node 2: Condition for setting apl1. Use: plt, plt1.
- Nodes 3 and 4: Assigning apl1 based on condition. Def: apl1; Use: wd2.
- Node 5: Calculating wd3. Def: wd3; Use: apl2.
- Nodes 6 and 7: Adjusting apl1. Use: apl1, wd3.

I'll represent each basic block as a node in the graph, with edges showing control flow based on conditions. Data flow will be shown through edges labeled with variable names.

Now, structuring the DOT code:

- Set `rankdir=TB` for vertical layout.
- Nodes are boxes except decisions which are diamonds.
- Each node has labels indicating definitions and uses.

I'll make sure to include all variables' usages (C-use) and definitions (def). For example, in BB1, al1 is read, and wd2 is written. In the condition nodes, variables like plt and plt1 are C-used.

Edges will show control flow with conditions as labels. For instance, from node 2 to 3: "True" and to 4: "False".

I should also represent loops or jumps correctly, but since this function doesn't have any loops, it's straightforward.

Finally, the last node is a double circle indicating the end of the function.
