Based on the analysis of the logsch function and its CDFG, there are no infeasible paths because all possible execution routes through the function are valid under normal operation. Each condition check logically leads to a feasible outcome without any contradictions or infinite loops when considering the actual code structure.

**Final Answer:**

There are no infeasible paths in the logsch function based on its provided CDFG and code logic. All potential execution paths are feasible as per the function's intended behavior. 

\boxed{\text{No infeasible paths exist in the logsch function}}
