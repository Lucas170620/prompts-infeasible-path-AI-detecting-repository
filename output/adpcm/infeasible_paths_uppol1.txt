After carefully analyzing the function and its CDFG, all potential execution paths appear to be feasible under different input scenarios. There are no contradictions or impossible conditions that would make any path infeasible.

**Final Answer:**

There are no infeasible paths in the provided CDFG for `uppol1`. All four possible execution paths (A, B, C, D) are feasible depending on the values of the input variables.
