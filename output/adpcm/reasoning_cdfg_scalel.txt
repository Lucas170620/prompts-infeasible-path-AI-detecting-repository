Okay, I need to generate a precise Hybrid Control and Data Flow Graph (CDFG) in Graphviz DOT format for the function `scalel` from the provided code. Let me start by understanding what `scalel` does.

Looking at the code:

int scalel(int nbh) {
    int wd;
    wd = ((long)nbh * 127L) >> 7L; // leak factor of 127/128
    if(wd > 15359) wd = 15359;   // upper limit
    if(wd < -15360) wd = -15360; // lower limit
    return (wd << 3);            // multiply by 8
}

So, the function takes an integer `nbh` as input. It computes `wd` by multiplying `nbh` with 127, shifting right by 7 bits. Then it checks if `wd` exceeds certain thresholds and clamps its value. Finally, it returns `wd` shifted left by 3.

First, I'll break down the function into basic blocks:

1. Compute wd.
2. Check if wd > 15359.
3. If so, set wd to 15359.
4. Else, proceed.
5. Then check if wd < -15360.
6. If so, set wd to -15360.
7. Finally, return wd << 3.

Wait, but in the code, after computing `wd`, it directly applies both upper and lower limits. So it's two separate if statements, not nested.

So, the control flow is:

Compute wd -> check upper limit -> clamp if needed -> check lower limit -> clamp if needed -> return.

But since each condition is a separate if, they're independent. So in CDFG terms, each condition creates a branch.

Now, to construct the CDFG for `scalel`.

Each node represents a basic block. The nodes will have labels indicating their operation and data flow information.

Variables involved: nbh (input), wd (defined and used multiple times).

Let me list the steps as nodes:

1. Compute wd = ((long)nbh * 127L) >> 7L.
   - This is a calculation, so it's an assignment node.

2. Check if wd > 15359.
   - Condition node with label "if (wd > 15359)".
   
3. If true, set wd = 15359.
   - Assignment node for setting wd to upper limit.

4. Else, proceed to next check.
   - This is a false edge leading to the lower limit check.

Wait, actually, in code:

After computing `wd`, it checks if `wd > 15359` and clamps. Then, regardless of that, it checks if `wd < -15360`.

So the control flow after `wd` computation is:

- Check upper limit: if true, set wd to 15359.
- (whether or not) then check lower limit: if true, set wd to -15360.

Wait no. The code has two separate ifs in sequence. So the function doesn't have nested ifs but sequential checks.

So after `wd` is computed:

If wd > 15359 -> clamp to 15359.

Then, check if wd < -15360 (after clamping) and clamp again.

Wait no, because in code it's two separate if statements. So if `wd` was greater than 15359, set it to 15359. Then, regardless of that result, check if `wd` is less than -15360, and if so, set it to -15360.

Wait no: looking at the code:

if (wd > 15359) { wd = 15359; }
if (wd < -15360) { wd = -15360; }

So these are two separate if statements executed in sequence. So after clamping the upper limit, it proceeds to check the lower limit.

Therefore, each condition is a node with possible branches, but they are not nested. They are sequential.

So the CDFG will have nodes for:

- Compute wd (node 1)
- Check if wd > 15359 and branch accordingly (nodes 2 and 3)
- Then, check if wd < -15360 and branch (nodes 4 and 5)
- Finally, return wd << 3 (node 6)

But wait, after setting `wd` in the first condition, the second condition uses the possibly updated value of `wd`.

So each assignment to `wd` affects the subsequent conditions.

Now, structuring this into nodes:

1. Node for computing `wd`.
2. Condition node checking `wd > 15359`.
   - If true: set wd to 15359 (node A)
   - Else: proceed (node B)
3. Then, after that, condition node checking `wd < -15360` using the current value of `wd`.
   - If true: set wd to -15360 (node C)
   - Else: proceed (node D)
4. Finally, return `wd << 3`.

So each step is a separate basic block.

But in terms of the graph:

Compute `wd` -> condition on upper limit -> if so, assign and then check lower limit again.

Wait no, because the two conditions are sequential. So after computing `wd`, we have two separate checks in sequence.

Therefore, the CDFG will look like this:

Start at compute wd (node 1).

Then to condition node 2: if wd > 15359? If yes, go to node A; else, proceed to node 3.

After node 3, we have another condition node for the lower limit.

Wait, no. Let me model it correctly:

Node 1: Compute `wd`.

From node 1, there is a directed edge to node 2 (the upper limit check).

Node 2 has two edges: one for true (to node A), and one for false (to node 3).

At node A: set `wd = 15359`, then proceed to the next condition.

But in code, after setting `wd` in the first if, the second if is executed regardless. So from node A, we need to go back to the lower limit check? Or wait, no—node A represents the assignment after the upper condition. Then, the function proceeds to execute the lower condition regardless of whether it was taken or not.

Wait, perhaps it's better to model each condition as a separate node in sequence.

So:

Compute `wd` (node 1) → check if wd > 15359 (node 2). If true: set wd and proceed to node 3; else: go to node 3.

Then, after that, check if wd < -15360 (node 3), with its own branches. Wait, no—this is getting a bit tangled.

Alternatively, perhaps the two conditions are independent and should be represented in sequence without branching between them except at their respective condition nodes.

Let me re-express:

Node 1: compute wd.

Edges from node 1 go to node 2 (upper limit check).

At node 2: if true → node A (assign wd=15359), else → node 3.

After node A, proceed to node 3.

Wait no: after node 2's false case, we still need to execute the lower limit condition. So from node 2's false edge, go directly to node 3.

So:

Compute `wd` (node1) → check upper limit (node2). If true, assign wd=15359 (nodeA), then proceed to lower limit check (node3). Else, just proceed to lower limit check (node3).

At node3: check if wd < -15360. If true, assign wd=-15360 (nodeB), else → node4.

From nodeB, go to node4.

Node4 is the final assignment after both clamps, which then returns wd << 3.

Wait, but in code, after setting `wd` in either clamp, the next condition still uses the updated value. So after nodeA (upper clamp), we have to check the lower limit again with the new value of `wd`.

Therefore:

node1 → node2

node2 has edges: true → nodeA; false → node3.

After nodeA, go to node3.

node3 has edges: true → nodeB; false → node4.

From nodeB, proceed to node4.

Then node4 is the return statement.

Wait no. After nodeB (assigning lower limit), there's nothing else except returning. So from nodeB, go to node5 (return). Or perhaps node4 is the return.

Alternatively:

node1: compute wd

→ node2: check upper limit.

if true → nodeA; else → proceed to node3.

At nodeA: assign wd=15359 → then proceed to node3.

Node3: check if wd < -15360.

If true → nodeB (assign wd=-15360); else → node4.

From nodeB, go to node4.

node4 is the return statement.

So nodes:

1. Compute wd.
2. Check upper limit.
   a. If yes: assign wd=15359 → A
   b. Else: proceed → 3

A → 3.

3. Check lower limit.
   a. If yes: assign wd=-15360 → B
   b. Else: proceed →4.

B →4.

4. Return wd <<3.

Wait, but in code after nodeA (assigning upper), it proceeds to the lower check, which is at node3.

So perhaps:

node2 → A or 3.

If taken to A, then from A, go to node3.

Alternatively, perhaps node3 represents both conditions. Hmm, no, that's not correct.

Wait, maybe a better approach is to list each step as separate nodes, considering each assignment and condition.

Let me outline the basic blocks:

BB1: compute wd.
BB2: if (wd > 15359) then set wd = 15359; else continue.
BB3: if (wd < -15360) then set wd = -15360; else continue.
BB4: return wd <<3.

But BB2 and BB3 are separate, so the flow is:

BB1 → BB2 → [if true] BB2a (assignment), then to BB3.

[If false from BB2], go directly to BB3.

Similarly, from BB3, if true → BB3a (assignment), else proceed to BB4.

Wait no: in code, after BB2 is executed (whether or not it changes `wd`), BB3 is always executed.

So the flow is:

BB1 → BB2.

From BB2:

- If taken (true), then execute BB2a (assignment) and then proceed to BB3.
- Else, proceed directly to BB3.

Then from BB3:

- If taken (true), execute BB3a (assignment) and proceed to BB4.
- Else, proceed directly to BB4.

Thus, the nodes would be structured as:

1. Compute wd → node1.

2. Check if wd > 15359 → node2.

   - If yes: assign wd=15359 → nodeA; then go to node3.
   - Else: proceed to node3.

3. At node3, check if wd < -15360.

   - If yes: assign wd=-15360 → nodeB; then go to node4.
   - Else: proceed to node4.

4. Compute return value → node4 (wd <<3).

So the CDFG nodes are:

- Node1: compute `wd`.
- Node2: condition on `wd > 15359`.
- NodeA: assignment `wd = 15359`.
- Node3: condition on `wd < -15360`.
- NodeB: assignment `wd = -15360`.
- Node4: return `wd <<3`.

The edges are:

Node1 → Node2.

From Node2: true → NodeA; false → Node3.

After NodeA: to Node3.

From Node3: true → NodeB; false → Node4.

After NodeB: to Node4.

So, in terms of the graph structure:

- node1 → node2
- node2 has edges:
   - yes → nodeA
   - no → node3
- nodeA → node3
- node3 has edges:
   - yes → nodeB
   - no → node4
- nodeB → node4
- node4 is the end.

Each node will have labels indicating their operation and data flow information, including variables read and written.

Now, considering data dependencies:

- Node1 reads `nbh`, writes `wd`.
- Node2 reads `wd`.
- NodeA writes `wd` (sets to 15359).
- Node3 reads `wd`.
- NodeB writes `wd` (sets to -15360).
- Node4 reads `wd`.

Variables involved: nbh is input, wd is computed and modified.

So each node's label should indicate:

For example, node1 could be labeled as "Compute wd = ((long)nbh * 127L) >>7".

Node2: condition on (wd > 15359).

Now, let me outline the nodes with their properties.

Node1:
- Operation: Compute `wd`.
- Inputs: nbh.
- Outputs: wd.

Edges from node1 → node2.

Node2:
- Operation: if (wd > 15359)
- Inputs: wd.
- Outputs: no changes yet, but control flow branches.

Edges:

- If true: to NodeA
- Else: to Node3

NodeA:
- Operation: assign `wd = 15359`.
- Inputs: none (reads nothing except existing `wd`, which is modified)
- Outputs: wd.

Edge from NodeA → node3.

Node3:
- Operation: if (wd < -15360)
- Inputs: wd.
- Outputs: control flow branches.

Edges:

- If true: to NodeB
- Else: to Node4

NodeB:
- Operation: assign `wd = -15360`.
- Inputs: none
- Outputs: wd.

Edge from NodeB → node4.

Node4:
- Operation: return `wd << 3`
- Inputs: wd.
- Outputs: returns the value.

So, in the DOT file:

Each node is a rectangle with its operation and data flow info.

Now, considering how to represent this in Graphviz.

I'll create nodes as follows:

1. Node1: Compute wd.
2. Node2: if (wd > 15359)
   - yes → NodeA
   - no → Node3
3. NodeA: wd = 15359 → Node3
4. Node3: if (wd < -15360)
   - yes → NodeB
   - no → Node4
5. NodeB: wd = -15360 → Node4
6. Node4: return wd << 3

Putting this into a DOT file structure with appropriate edges and labels.

I'll also need to represent the data dependencies, but since it's a control flow graph, perhaps the labels will suffice for now.

Now, considering how to format each node with its operation and variables.

For example:

- Node1: label="Compute wd = ((long)nbh * 127L) >> 7"
- Node2: label="if (wd > 15359)"
- NodeA: label="wd = 15359"
- Node3: label="if (wd < -15360)"
- NodeB: label="wd = -15360"
- Node4: label="return wd << 3"

Edges will be directed from each node to the next, with labels indicating conditions where applicable.

In the DOT file:

Start by defining all nodes with their labels and properties.

Then define edges between them as per the control flow.

So the structure would look like:

digraph scalel_graph {
    node1 [label="Compute wd = ((long)nbh * 127L) >>7", shape=rectangle];
    node2 [label="if (wd > 15359)", shape=rectangle];
    nodeA [label="wd = 15359", shape=rectangle];
    node3 [label="if (wd < -15360)", shape=rectangle];
    nodeB [label="wd = -15360", shape=rectangle];
    node4 [label="return wd << 3", shape=rectangle];

    // Edges
    node1 -> node2;
    node2 -> nodeA [label="true"];
    node2 -> node3 [label="false"];
    nodeA -> node3;
    node3 -> nodeB [label="true"];
    node3 -> node4 [label="false"];
    nodeB -> node4;
}

Wait, but from node2, the false case goes to node3. Then, after processing nodeA (if taken), it proceeds to node3.

Similarly, nodeA's output is to node3 regardless of its condition.

But in code, after assigning in nodeA (wd=15359), we still have to check if this new wd is less than -15360. So the flow from nodeA must go back to node3.

Thus, nodeA's edge leads to node3.

Similarly, nodeB's assignment leads to node4.

This structure should capture all possible control flows.

I think that covers the entire function's logic.
