Okay, I need to analyze the given code and its CDFG to identify infeasible paths. Let's start by understanding the function 'quantl' which seems to be part of some signal processing or encoding/decoding logic.

Looking at the code for 'quantl', it's a function that manipulates variables like wd2, apl2, wd3, and eventually returns a result. The CDFG provided is a graph showing the control flow and data dependencies between these nodes.

First, I'll map each node in the CDFG to the corresponding code snippets:

- Node 1: Corresponds to where 'wd2' is defined and modified based on the condition (long)plt*plt1 >=0L. Then 'wd4' is generated by shifting wd2 right by 7 bits.
- Node 2: This seems to be the conditional check if (long)plt*plt1 >= 0L, which determines whether to modify 'wd2'.
- Node 3: Here, apl2 is calculated based on whether 'wd4' is non-negative. If true, apl2 = wd4 + 128; else, apl2 = wd4 - 128.
- Node 4: Another condition checking (long)plt*plt2 >=0L, which then leads to a decision point.
- Node 5: 'wd3' is defined, possibly based on 'apl2'.
- Node 6: A conditional check on 'apl2', leading to different paths.
- Node 7: Calculates 'apl1' using 'wd2' and conditions based on (long)plt*plt1 >=0L.
- Node 8: Another condition that affects the flow, leading to node 9.
- Node 9: The final result is defined here.

Now, I'll list all possible paths through this CDFG:

1. From Node 1 -> Node 2 (if condition true) -> Node 3 -> Node5 -> Node6 (assuming some condition on apl2) then to subsequent nodes.
2. Alternatively, if the condition at Node2 is false, it might go to Node4 instead.
3. Similarly, other paths diverge based on conditions in Nodes 2,4,6,8.

Next, I need to check for infeasible paths by looking for logical contradictions or data dependencies that can't be satisfied.

Looking closely:

- At Node1: 'wd2' is modified based on (long)plt*plt1 >=0L. If this condition is true, wd2 becomes negative of its original value.
- Then at Node3: apl2 depends on whether 'wd4' (which is wd2 >>7) is positive or not.

Wait a minute. Let's think about what happens when the condition in Node2 is true:

If (long)plt*plt1 >=0L is true, then wd2 becomes -wd2. Suppose plt and plt1 are such that their product is positive. Then wd2 would be negative if it was originally positive, or vice versa.

After this, at Node3: apl2 is calculated as wd4 + 128 if wd4 >=0, else wd4-128. Since wd4 = wd2 >>7, which for a long might not change the sign (depending on how right shift works in C). But if wd2 was modified to be negative due to Node2's condition, then wd4 could be negative.

But wait, let me consider specific cases:

Case 1: Suppose after Node2, wd2 is negative. Then wd4 = wd2 >>7. In two's complement, shifting a negative number right fills with ones, so wd4 would remain negative if the shift doesn't make it zero.

At Node3: apl2 is calculated as wd4 +128 or wd4 -128 depending on sign of wd4. If wd4 is negative (since wd2 was made negative in Node2), then apl2 becomes wd4 -128, which makes it even more negative.

Then at Node6: I assume there's a condition based on apl2's value. Suppose Node6 checks if apl2 >=0 or something. But since apl2 is very negative here, that condition would be false.

But let's see where this leads. If the path goes through Node3->Node5->Node6 (if condition), then perhaps to Node7 or others.

Alternatively, what if in some paths, after certain operations, variables take on values that make subsequent conditions impossible?

For example, suppose after calculating apl2 as a very negative number, any later condition expecting apl2 to be positive would never be true. But without seeing all the code, it's hard to tell.

Another area is at Node7: where 'apl1' is defined based on wd2 and another condition. If the conditions earlier have set variables in a way that makes this impossible, that could create an infeasible path.

Wait, let's think about logical contradictions:

In Node3, after modifying apl2, suppose later there's a condition expecting apl2 to be positive when it can't be based on prior steps. That would make such a path impossible.

For example, if after Node3, the function expects apl2 to be greater than some value but due to earlier modifications, it's always less, then any path requiring apl2 to meet that higher value is infeasible.

But without more context on how 'apl2' is used elsewhere, it's tricky. Alternatively, maybe certain combinations of conditions can't happen together.

For instance:

If (long)plt*plt1 >=0L is true at Node2, leading to wd2 being negative, and then at Node4 another condition is checked which depends on plt*plt2. But if earlier steps have fixed the sign or value in a way that makes this impossible, it could lead to contradictions.

Wait, looking back at the code provided for 'quantl' function:

The user provided only partial code snippets under <codigos - quantl> for each node. Let me parse those:

Node1:
wd2 = ((long)al1*255L) >>8L;
if ((long)plt*plt1 >=0L) {
    wd2 = -wd2;
}
wd4 = wd2 >>7; // Geração de wd4

So, after calculating wd2, if the product of plt and plt1 is non-negative, wd2 becomes its negative. Then wd4 is a right shift by 7 bits.

Node3's code:
if (wd4 >=0) {
    apl2 = wd4 +128;
} else {
    apl2 = wd4 -128;
}
return apl2;

So, based on the sign of wd4, apl2 is adjusted.

Now, let's think about possible scenarios:

Scenario 1: (long)plt*plt1 >=0L is true at Node2.

Then wd2 becomes -wd2. So if original wd2 was positive, it becomes negative. Then wd4 = wd2 >>7. If wd2 is now a negative long, shifting right by 7 bits would result in a negative number (since sign bit is extended). Thus, wd4 would be negative.

At Node3: since wd4 <0, apl2 becomes wd4 -128, making it even more negative.

Now, any later condition expecting apl2 to be >= something positive would fail. For example, if there's a check like if (apl2 > 5), this condition can never be true in this path because apl2 is very negative.

So, any path that depends on apl2 being positive after this scenario is infeasible.

Similarly, Scenario 2: If (long)plt*plt1 >=0L is false at Node2. Then wd2 remains as ((long)al1*255L)>>8L.

Assuming al1 and plt are such that this doesn't necessarily make wd2 positive or negative. But then in Node3, depending on wd4's sign, apl2 could be either increased or decreased.

But without knowing the exact values of these variables, it's hard to say for sure which paths are infeasible. However, based on logical conditions and possible outcomes, we can identify some paths that cannot occur under any circumstances.

For example:

Looking at Nodes 1-2-3-5-6: If after Node3, apl2 is calculated as a very negative number due to Scenario1, then any path that requires apl2 to be positive (e.g., an if condition checking apl2 > X where X is a positive number) would never be taken. Hence, such paths are infeasible.

Another example: If the function later uses apl2 in a way that expects it to be within certain bounds, but due to earlier operations, it's outside those bounds, making subsequent conditions impossible.

So, for each possible path through the CDFG, I need to check if there exists at least one execution where all conditions along that path are met. If not, the path is infeasible.

One specific case:

Consider a path where after Node1-2-3 (Scenario1), apl2 becomes very negative. Then, suppose later in the code, there's a condition like 'if (apl2 > 0)' which would never be true here. Therefore, any path going through this scenario and then requiring 'apl2>0' is infeasible.

But since I don't have the full function, it's challenging to map all possible paths. However, based on the nodes provided, I can identify at least one such case.

For example:

- Path: Node1 → Node2 (True) → Node3 → ... leads to apl2 being negative.
If later in the code, there's a condition expecting apl2 to be positive, that path is infeasible.

Another possible scenario is conflicting conditions on plt and plt1 leading to impossible states. For instance, if plt*plt1 >=0L (Node2) and then later plt*plt2 <0L (Node4), but the variables are such that both can't happen simultaneously.

But without more context, it's hard to pinpoint exact paths.

In conclusion, after analyzing the nodes and their dependencies, there exist certain paths where logical contradictions or impossible variable states occur, making those paths infeasible.
