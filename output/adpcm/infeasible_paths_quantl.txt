Based on the analysis of the 'quantl' function and its CDFG, we can identify several infeasible paths due to logical contradictions or data dependencies that cannot be satisfied.

### Infeasible Paths Analysis:

1. **Path 1: Node1 → Node2 (Condition True) → Node3**
   - If `(long)plt*plt1 >=0L` is true at Node2, `wd2` becomes negative.
   - Then, `wd4 = wd2 >>7`, which results in a negative number since `wd2` was made negative.
   - At Node3, `apl2` is calculated as `wd4 - 128`, making it even more negative.
   - **Infeasibility:** Any subsequent path that requires `apl2` to be positive (e.g., `if(apl2 > 5)`) cannot be satisfied because `apl2` is very negative. Therefore, paths expecting a positive `apl2` after this scenario are infeasible.

### Conclusion:
The identified infeasible path occurs when `(long)plt*plt1 >=0L` leads to a situation where `apl2` becomes negative, making any subsequent conditions requiring `apl2` to be positive impossible. This results in certain paths through the CDFG being logically infeasible under all circumstances.

**Final Answer:**
The path from Node1 → Node2 (Condition True) → Node3 leads to an infeasible scenario where `apl2` becomes negative, making any subsequent conditions expecting a positive `apl2` impossible. Therefore, such paths are infeasible.
