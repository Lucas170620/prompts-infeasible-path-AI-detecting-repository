Okay, I'm trying to analyze the logsch function and its CDFG to find any infeasible paths. Let's start by understanding what the logsch function does.

Looking at the code for logsch:

int logsch(int ih, int nbh) {
    int wd;
    wd = ((long)nbh * 127L) >> 7; // This is a right shift after multiplying by 127
    nbh = wd + wh_code_table[ih];
    if (nbh < 0) {
        nbh = 0;
    } else if (nbh > 22528) { // Wait, in the code it's '>', but looking at the original function, the user wrote '>=' ?
        nbh = 22528;
    }
    return nbh;
}

Wait, no. Looking back, the original code says:

nbh = ((long)nbh * 127L) >> 7;

Then:

nbh = wd + wh_code_table[ih];

Then:

if (nbh <0 ) { ... }

else if (nbh > 22528) { ... }

Wait, no: In the code provided by the user, logsch is written as:

int logsch(int ih, int nbh)
{
    int wd;
    wd = ((long)nbh * 127L)>>7; 
    nbh = wd + wh_code_table[ih];
    if (nbh <0 ) nbh=0;
    else if (nbh>22528) nbh=22528;
    return nbh;
}

So the conditions are:

if (nbh < 0) set to 0.

else if (nbh > 22528), set to 22528.

Wait, but in the CDFG provided by the user, nodes 3 and 5 have labels nbh<0 and nbh>22528. Let me check:

The user's CDFG is:

digraph logsch {
    rankdir=TB;
    node [shape=circle];
    
    1 [label="1", xlabel="Def: wd\nC-Use: nbh"];
    2 [label="2", xlabel="Def: nbh\nP-Use: ih"];
    3 [label="3", shape=diamond, xlabel="nbh < 0"];
    4 [label="4", xlabel="nbh = 0"];
    5 [label="5", shape=diamond, xlabel="nbh > 22528"];
    6 [label="6", xlabel="nbh = 22528"];
    7 [label="7", shape=doublecircle];
    
    1 -> 2;
    2 -> 3;
    3 -> 4 [label="True"];
    3 -> 2 [label="False"];
    4 -> 5;
    5 -> 6 [label="True"];
    5 -> 7 [label="False"];
    6 -> 7;
}

So node 3 is the condition nbh <0, and node5 is nbh>22528.

Now, the function's logic after the assignment:

- Compute wd based on nbh.
- Then compute new nbh as wd + wh_code_table[ih].
- Then check if nbh is less than 0: if yes, set to 0 (node4).
- Else, check if it's greater than 22528: if yes, set to 22528 (node6). Otherwise, keep as is.

But looking at the CDFG, after node2, it goes to node3 which is nbh<0. If true, go to node4, else back to node2? Or does it proceed?

Wait, in the graph:

1 -> 2

Then 2->3 (nbh <0 condition). 

From 3: if True, go to 4; False, go back to 2. But wait, that would create a loop if nbh is not less than zero.

But looking at node4: it's xlabel "nbh=0". So after setting nbh=0 (node4), it proceeds to node5, which checks nbh>22528. Since 0 is not >22528, it would go to node7 via the False edge.

Wait no:

In the CDFG:

After node3 (nbh<0):

- If True: goes to node4 (set to 0), then from node4->node5.

From node5 (nbh>22528?):

If True, go to node6; else, go to node7.

Similarly, if in node3, the condition is False (nbh >=0), it goes back to node2. But wait, that doesn't make sense because after setting nbh, you can't loop back without reprocessing. So perhaps I'm misunderstanding the graph structure.

Alternatively, maybe the CDFG has a mistake. Because in code:

After node2, which is the assignment nbh = wd + ..., then we check if nbh <0 (node3). If yes, set to 0 (node4), then proceed to check >22528 at node5.

If not <0, then go directly to node5 (checking for >22528).

So the CDFG might have a mistake in the edges. Because after node3, if false, it should proceed to node5, not back to node2.

Wait, let's look at the original code again:

After nbh is computed as wd + ..., we check if (nbh <0). If yes, set to 0. Then, else, check if (nbh>22528) and set accordingly.

So after processing node3, whether it's true or false, we proceed to the next condition. So in the CDFG, from node3:

- True: go to node4 (set to 0), then to node5.

- False: go directly to node5.

But according to the provided CDFG, when node3 is false, it goes back to node2, which doesn't make sense because we've already computed nbh and can't loop back without reprocessing.

This might be an error in the CDFG. Perhaps the correct structure is that after node2 (nbh assignment), you go to node3; if true, set to 0, then proceed to node5. If false at node3, proceed to node5 directly.

So perhaps the edges are incorrect. Let me re-examine the graph:

Edges in the CDFG:

1 -> 2;

2->3;

3->4 [True];

3->2 [False]; // This seems wrong because after checking <0 and it's false, we shouldn't loop back to node2.

Then from node4 (after setting nbh=0), you go to node5.

From node5: if True (nbh>22528) go to node6; else go to node7.

So in the CDFG as provided, after node3's False condition, it loops back to node2. But that would imply re-executing node2's code again, which is not how the function works.

This suggests that the CDFG might have an error in its structure. Therefore, when analyzing, I need to consider whether this edge exists or not.

Assuming that the correct CDFG should be:

After node3 (nbh<0):

- If True: go to node4, then proceed to node5.

- If False: go directly to node5.

Thus, in the graph, node3's false condition should point to node5, not back to node2. The current CDFG has a loop from node3 (False) to node2, which is incorrect.

Now, moving on to identifying possible paths and checking for infeasible ones.

First, let's list all possible paths through the CDFG:

1. Path 1: 1 → 2 → 3 →4 →5→6→7

This would be when nbh <0 after computation. Then it sets to 0, then checks if >22528 (which is false), so returns.

But wait, node5 is checking nbh>22528 after setting nbh=0, which will always be false because 0 is not greater than 22528. So in this path:

nbh <0 → set to 0 → check if >22528 (no) → return.

So nbh ends up being 0.

Another possible path: 

2. Path 2: 1→2→3 →4 →5 →7

Wait, no. From node4, you go to node5.

If at node5, condition is false (nbh not >22528), so proceed to node7.

So in this case, after setting nbh=0, it's less than 22528, so returns 0.

Another path:

3. Path 3:1→2→3→False →5→6→7

This is when nbh <0 condition is false (nbh >=0), but then in node5, nbh>22528 is true. So set to 22528 and return.

Another path:

4. Path 4:1→2→3→False →5→7

Here, nbh>=0 after initial assignment, and also <=22528, so no change.

Now, let's check if any of these paths are infeasible.

Infeasibility would mean that certain conditions cannot be met given the function's logic.

Looking at Path 1: when does nbh <0 occur?

It depends on the initial value of nbh and wh_code_table[ih].

But since wd is ((long)nbh *127L)>>7, which shifts right by 7 bits. So for example:

If nbh is negative, multiplying by 127 (positive), then shifting right would make it more negative.

Wait no: in C, the sign bit is extended when using signed right shift.

So if nbh is negative, say nbh = -100, then ((long)nbh *127L) would be a large negative number. Shifting right 7 bits would give a negative wd, so wd could be negative or positive depending on the multiplication and shifting.

Then, nbh becomes wd + wh_code_table[ih]. So even if initial nbh is negative, after this calculation, it's possible that nbh becomes positive or more negative.

But for the logsch function:

After setting nbh as wd + ..., which could be anything, we clamp it to 0 if <0 and 22528 if >.

Now, can any of these conditions lead to infeasible paths?

Looking at Path1: nbh <0 after assignment. Then set to 0. So after that, checking if 0>22528 is false, so returns 0. This path is always feasible when the initial condition holds.

Path3: After initial computation, nbh >=0 but >22528. So this can happen if wh_code_table[ih] plus wd exceeds 22528. So it's possible, hence feasible.

Path4: nbh after assignment is between 0 and 22528. Feasible.

What about the possibility that after setting to 0 in node4, the subsequent check at node5 could be true? But since 0 is not >22528, it's always false. So this path is feasible but will never set to 6.

Wait, but what if there are multiple passes through these nodes?

But given the function structure, each step happens once.

Another consideration: can nbh after assignment be both <0 and >22528 at the same time? No, because a number can't be less than zero and greater than 22528 simultaneously. So in any case, only one of the conditions will apply or none.

Wait no: if nbh is assigned a value that's both <0 and >22528, which isn't possible since those are mutually exclusive.

So what about when the initial assignment results in nbh being within [0, 22528]? Then neither condition applies, so returns as is. Feasible.

Now, looking for any impossible conditions.

Is there a scenario where after node4 (nbh=0), we go to node5 and then have nbh>22528? Since after node4, nbh is 0, it's not possible for the condition at node5 to be true. So in that path, from node4→node5: since nbh is 0, the condition at node5 (nbh>22528) is false, leading to node7.

So that path is fine and can't have any issues.

Another angle: Can the assignment of wd cause nbh to be negative or overflow? Let's see:

wd = ((long)nbh *127L)>>7;

Assuming nbh is a 32-bit integer, when cast to long (64 bits), multiplying by 127 could go up to (for positive nbh):

If nbh is maximum int (e.g., 2^31-1 for 32-bit), then 127*(2^31-1) would be a large number, but when shifted right by 7 bits, it's divided by 128. So wd could still fit within an integer.

But if nbh is negative and multiplied by 127L, which is positive, then wd will be a negative number. When adding wh_code_table[ih], which I assume is some precomputed value, the resulting nbh can be negative or positive.

So it's possible for the function to assign any integer value, but after clamping, it'll be between 0 and 22528.

Another thought: what if after node4 (nbh=0), when we proceed to node5, but wh_code_table[ih] is such that adding wd makes nbh jump beyond 22528? Wait no. Because after setting nbh=0 in node4, the code then checks for >22528, which would be false.

Wait, no: After node4 (nbh=0), it's now 0, so checking if 0>22528 is false.

So the only way to reach node6 is if after initial assignment, nbh was greater than 22528.

Thus, all paths are feasible as per the function logic. So perhaps there are no infeasible paths.

Wait, but looking back at the CDFG structure provided by the user: from node3 (nbh<0), on false condition, it goes to node2 again, which might not be accurate.

If that's the case, then when node3 is false, the function loops back to node2, which would re-execute the assignment nbh = wd + ... So this could create a loop if, for example, after setting nbh=0 in node4 and going back to node2, but this isn't how the code works.

But according to the actual code, after the initial assignment at node2, it doesn't go back; instead, it proceeds to check conditions. Therefore, the CDFG provided by the user might have an error in edges from node3. So when analyzing based on the correct function logic, there's no loop, hence all paths are feasible.

Wait, but if the CDFG as provided has a cycle (node3 false→node2), then that would create a possible infinite loop, which is impossible because the function must terminate. Therefore, any path that leads to such a cycle in reality can't happen because the code doesn't have such logic.

Therefore, when analyzing based on correct function behavior, we should assume that after node3's false condition, it proceeds to node5, not back to node2.

In this case, all paths are feasible as per the function's intended behavior.

Wait, but in the provided CDFG, there is a path from node3 (False) → node2, which isn't how the code works. So perhaps that edge is incorrect and should be removed or corrected to point to node5 instead.

In any case, based on the actual code logic, after processing node3, regardless of true/false, we proceed to node5. Therefore, in terms of feasible paths:

1. Path where nbh<0 → set to 0 → return (after checking >22528 which is false).

2. Path where nbh>=0 and <=22528 → no change.

3. Path where nbh>22528 → set to 22528.

None of these are impossible, so there's no infeasible path.
