Okay, I need to analyze the `scalel` function and its provided CDFG to identify any infeasible paths. Let me start by understanding what the function does.

Looking at the code for `scalel`, it seems like the function takes an integer `nbh` as input. It then computes a value `wd` using bitwise operations on `nbh`. The computation is done by casting `nbh` to a long, multiplying by 127, and then right-shifting by 7 bits. 

After computing `wd`, there are several checks:
1. If `wd` is greater than 15359, it's set to 15359.
2. Then, if the resulting `wd` is less than -15360, it's set to -15360.
3. Finally, the function returns `wd` shifted left by 3 bits.

Now, looking at the CDFG provided:

- Node1 computes `wd = ((long)nbh * 127L) >> 7`.
- Node2 checks if `wd > 15359`. If true, goes to nodeA (sets wd=15359), else proceeds.
- From nodeA, it then checks again in node3 whether `wd < -15360`.
- Similarly, from node3, if true, sets wd=-15360; else returns.

Wait a minute. If `wd` was greater than 15359 and gets set to 15359 at NodeA, then in the next check (Node3), can `wd` be less than -15360? That seems impossible because `wd` is now 15359, which is a positive number. So moving from NodeA to Node3 and checking if `15359 < -15360` will always be false.

Therefore, the path through Nodes A → B (which I assume is node3) would have an impossible condition. Because after setting wd=15359, checking if it's less than -15360 can never be true.

So, any path that goes Node2 → NodeA and then to Node3 will result in an infeasible path because the condition at node3 cannot be satisfied.

Another point: If `wd` is set to 15359 at NodeA, when it proceeds to Node3, it's checking if 15359 < -15360. Since 15359 is positive and much larger than -15360 in absolute terms, this condition is always false.

Thus, the path A → B (node3) would be impossible because after setting `wd` to a high value, it can't be less than a very negative number. Therefore, any execution that reaches NodeA will never take the true branch from Node3, making that specific path infeasible.

So, this is an example of a static infeasibility due to logical contradiction.
