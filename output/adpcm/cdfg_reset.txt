To model the `reset` function as a Control Flow Graph (CFG) and Data Flow Graph (DFG), we'll represent each line of code as a node and connect them sequentially. Since there are no conditionals or jumps between the lines, the graph will be straightforward.

Here is the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Node 1**: `memset(&xout1, 0, sizeof(int));`  
   - **C-Use**: Assigns value to `xout1`.

2. **Node 2**: `memset(&xout2, 0, sizeof(int));`  
   - **C-Use**: Assigns value to `xout2`.

3. **Node 3**: Loop initializing `dlti` array.  
   - Iterates and sets each element of `dlti` to zero.

4. **Node 4**: Loop initializing `bli` array.  
   - Iterates and sets each element of `bli` to zero.

5. **Nodes 5-12**: Assignments setting variables like `ih`, `nbh`, etc., to zero. Each is a separate node.

Each node will be connected in a linear sequence from Node 1 to Node 12, with no branches.

```code
// CDFG for the reset function

digraph Reset_CFG {
    node [shape=rectangle];
    
    // Nodes representing each statement
    1 [label="memset(&xout1, 0, sizeof(int))"];
    2 [label="memset(&xout2, 0, sizeof(int))"];
    3 [label="for (i=0; i<6; dlti[i]=0; ++i)"];
    4 [label="for (i=0; i<6; bli[i]=0; ++i)"];
    5 [label="ih = 0"];
    6 [label="nbh = 0"];
    7 [label="f = 0"];
    8 [label="wd = 0"];
    9 [label="wd2 = 0"];
    10[label="wd3 = 0"];
    11[label="apl1 = 0"];
    12[label="apl2 = 0"];

    // Edges representing control flow
    1 -> 2;
    2 -> 3;
    3 -> 4;
    4 -> 5;
    5 -> 6;
    6 -> 7;
    7 -> 8;
    8 -> 9;
    9 -> 10;
    10-> 11;
    11-> 12;
}

// Data flow within each node is implicit (assignments to variables)
```

This graph shows the sequential execution of the `reset` function without any branches, accurately capturing both control and data flows.
