Okay, so I need to analyze the provided code and identify any infeasible paths based on the CDFG (Control Data Flow Graph) for each function. Let's start by understanding what an infeasible path is. It refers to a path through the program that cannot be executed under any circumstances, either because of logical contradictions or impossible data dependencies.

Looking at the given code snippets and their corresponding CDFGs, I'll go through each function one by one to spot potential issues.

First up is `logsch`. The CDFG shows nodes representing operations like defining variables and conditional checks. From what's provided, there are no obvious logical contradictions. Each condition (like nbh < 0 or nbh > 22528) leads to a feasible outcome without any mutual exclusivity that would make a path impossible.

Next is `uppol1`. Its CDFG looks a bit more complex with multiple conditional branches, but each path still seems valid. The conditions are such that they don't create impossible scenarios. For example, if apl1 is greater than wd3, it gets set to wd3; otherwise, it's adjusted in another way. No contradictions here.

Moving on to `uppol2`, the CDFG indicates several operations involving wd2 and apl2. The analysis already noted no infeasible paths, which makes sense since all conditions are designed to adjust values within certain ranges without conflicting logic.

Then there's `logsch` again with a similar setup as before, no issues detected, so I concur with the previous assessment.

The other functions like `uppol1` and others seem to follow similar patterns where each condition check is logically sound and doesn't lead to impossible situations. Without any contradictory conditions or impossible data dependencies, all paths appear feasible.

I should also consider if there are any dead codes or unreachable nodes in the CDFGs. From what's provided, all nodes seem reachable and contribute logically to the function's execution without any dead ends that would make a path inviable.

In conclusion, after carefully reviewing each function's CDFG and corresponding code, I find no evidence of infeasible paths. All potential execution routes are valid under different input scenarios.
