Okay, I need to analyze the given code and extract all user-defined functions. Let me go through each part step by step.

First, looking at the code, I see several function definitions. The first one is `reset()`. That's definitely a function. 

Next, there are two main functions: `encode` and `decode`, but wait, no—actually, in C, functions start with `int` or another type. Looking closer, I don't see `encode` or `decode` as standalone functions; instead, I see their implementation within the code.

Wait, looking again, I find that there's a function called `encode()`. Let me check: yes, it starts with `int encode(int test_data[2])`, but in the provided code, it's not explicitly defined. Hmm, perhaps I'm mistaken. Wait, no—looking at the main function, it calls `encode` and `decode` as functions, so they must be defined elsewhere.

Wait, in the code snippet provided, I don't see `encode()` or `decode()` function definitions. Let me check again. Oh, wait—the user included a lot of functions like `quantl`, `logscl`, etc., but not `encode`. Wait no—I think I'm getting confused.

Let me list all the functions I can spot:

1. `reset()`: Yes, that's a function.
2. `encode()`: I don't see it defined here; perhaps it's part of another section or maybe it's inlined? Or perhaps the user made a mistake and didn't include it. Alternatively, maybe I'm missing it.

Wait, looking back at the code, I realize that the functions like `quantl`, `logscl`, `filtez`, etc., are all user-defined. Let me go through each function:

- `reset()`: Yes.
- `detl`, but that's a variable, not a function.
- Then there's `encode()` called in the main function. Wait, no—searching for function definitions.

Looking at the code again: I see functions like `filtez(int *bpl,int *dlt)`, which is user-defined. Similarly, `filtep(int rlt1,int al1,int rlt2,int al2)`.

Then there's `quantl(int el,int detl)`, and so on. Let me list all the function names I can find:

- reset()
- filtez()
- filtep()
- quantl()
- logscl()
- scalel()
- upzero()
- uppol2()
- uppol1()
- logsch()

Additionally, in the main section, there's a call to `encode` and `decode`, but I don't see their definitions in this code. However, since they're called as functions, they must be defined elsewhere or perhaps were intended to be included but not present here. But according to the user's instructions, I should include all functions defined by the user.

Wait, looking again at the main function, it's inside a conditional block `#ifndef Seoul_Mate`, so maybe that part isn't meant to be considered as part of the functions to list. Therefore, perhaps the only user-defined functions are those outside this block.

So, compiling the list:

- reset()
- filtez()
- filtep()
- quantl()
- logscl()
- scalel()
- upzero()
- uppol2()
- uppol1()
- logsch()

Also, in the main function, `encode` and `decode` are called, but since their definitions aren't present here, I won't include them unless they're defined elsewhere. But in this code snippet, only the functions listed above are present.

Wait, looking again: Oh no, wait—I think I missed some. Let me check each function:

1. reset()
2. filtez(int *bpl,int *dlt)
3. filtep(int rlt1,int al1,int rlt2,int al2)
4. quantl(int el,int detl)
5. logscl(int il,int nbl)
6. scalel(int nbl,int shift_constant)
7. upzero(int dlt,int *dlti,int *bli)
8. uppol2(int al1,int al2,int plt,int plt1,int plt2)
9. uppol1(int al1,int apl2,int plt,int plt1)
10. logsch(int ih,int nbh)

That's ten functions.

Wait, but looking again at the code: I see that there are more functions like `filtez`, `filtep`, etc., and also some helper functions for sine tables and others, but those are variables or arrays, not functions.

So, to sum up, all the user-defined functions in the provided code are:

reset()
filtez()
filtep()
quantl()
logscl()
scalel()
upzero()
uppol2()
uppol1()
logsch()

I think that's it. Now, I'll list them as per the instructions.
