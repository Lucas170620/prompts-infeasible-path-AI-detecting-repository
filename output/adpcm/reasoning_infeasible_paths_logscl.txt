Okay, so I have to analyze the `logsch` function and its CDFG to identify any infeasible paths. Let me start by understanding what the function does and then look at the provided CDFG.

First, looking at the code for `logsch`. It seems to take two integers, `ih` and `nbh`, perform some computations, and return a modified value of `nbh`.

The function steps are:
1. Compute `wd = ((long)nbh * 127L) >> 7L;`
2. Then set `nbh = wd + wh_code_table[ih];`
3. Check if `nbh < 0`, and if so, set it to 0.
4. Check if `nbh > 22528`, and if so, set it to 22528.

Now, looking at the CDFG provided in the DOT format. The nodes are labeled with their operations and dependencies. Each node represents a basic block, and edges represent control flow.

The nodes are:
- Entry: Uses `ih` and `nbh`
- node2: Compute `wd`, defines `wd`
- node3: Recompute `nbh`, defines it
- node4: Check if `nbh < 0`
- node5a: Set `nbh = 0`
- node6: Proceed with no change
- node7: Check if `nbh > 22528`
- node8a: Set `nbh = 22528`
- Return nbh

The control flow edges connect these nodes based on the function's logic.

Now, I need to map each part of the code to the CDFG nodes. For example, node1 corresponds to the entry point where `ih` and `nbh` are used. Node2 computes `wd`, which is a transformation of `nbh`.

Next step: Identify all possible paths through the CDFG.

Looking at the structure:
- From Entry (node1) to node2.
- After computing `wd` in node2, proceed to node3 where `nbh` is recomputed.
- Then check if `nbh < 0` at node4. If true, go to node5a; else, proceed through node6.
- From there, regardless of the outcome of node4, move to node7 which checks if `nbh >22528`. Depending on that, it goes to node8a or directly to return.

So possible paths are:
1. Entry → node2 → node3 → node4 (true) → node5a → node7
   - Then either set to 22528 or proceed.
   
Wait, no. After node5a sets `nbh` to 0, it should go back to check the upper limit.

Similarly, if node4 is false (proceed via node6), then we check node7 again.

But let me think of all possible paths:

Path 1:
node1 → node2 → node3 → node4 (true) → node5a → node7
If at node7, `nbh` >22528 is false, proceed to return nbh.
If true, set to 22528 and return.

Path 2:
node1 → node2 → node3 → node4 (false) → node6 → node7
At node7, either set to 22528 or proceed.

Now, I need to see if any of these paths are infeasible.

Looking for contradictions. For example, after setting `nbh` to 0 in node5a, can `nbh >22528` be true? No, because 0 is not greater than 22528. So the path that goes through node5a (setting nbh=0) then reaches node7 which would have a condition that is false.

Therefore, in this case, after setting `nbh=0`, the subsequent check for `nbh>22528` will always be false. Hence, the path from node5a to node8a (setting nbh=22528) is impossible because `nbh` was just set to 0.

So that's a static infeasible path: After setting `nbh` to 0, it can't be greater than 22528. So the edge from node7 to node8a after coming from node5a would never be taken.

Another possible check is whether any variable isn't initialized, but looking at the function, all variables are properly assigned.

So this seems to be a static infeasible path because of data dependencies: After setting `nbh=0`, it's impossible for it to exceed 22528.
