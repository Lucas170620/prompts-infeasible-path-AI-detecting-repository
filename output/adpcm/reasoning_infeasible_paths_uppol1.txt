Okay, I need to analyze the given function `uppol1` and its CDFG to identify any infeasible paths. Let me start by understanding the code and the graph provided.

Looking at the code for `uppol1`, it seems like a function that manipulates some variables based on certain conditions. The CDFG is given as a Graphviz dot file, which I'll use to map out the possible execution paths.

First, let's break down what each node in the CDFG does according to the code mapping provided:

- **Node 1**: Computes `wd2` as `(al1 * 255) >> 8`. This is a calculation based on `al1`.
- **Node 2**: Checks if `(plt * plt1) >= 0L`. Depending on this condition, it will go to either Node 3 or Node 4.
- **Node 3**: If the condition in Node 2 is true, sets `apl1 = wd2 + 192`.
- **Node 4**: If the condition in Node 2 is false, sets `apl1 = wd2 - 192`.
- **Node 5**: Computes `wd3` as `15360 - apl2`. This depends on the value of `apl2`.
- **Node 6**: Checks if `apl1 > wd3`. Depending on this, it goes to Node 7 or Node 8.
- **Node 7**: If true in Node 6, sets `apl1` to `wd3`, capping it at a higher value.
- **Node 8**: If false in Node 6, sets `apl1` to `-wd3`, capping it at a lower value.

Now, the CDFG is structured as follows:
- Node 1 connects to Node 2 (since `wd2` is used in Node 2's condition).
- From Node 2, there are two branches: one true leading to Node 3 and false leading to Node 4.
- Both Nodes 3 and 4 connect to Node 6, which has another conditional branching.
- Depending on the result of Node 6, it either goes to Node 7 or Node 8, both connecting back to Node 5, which is a terminal node (double circle).

So the possible execution paths are:

1. **Path A**: Node 1 → Node 2 (True) → Node 3 → Node 6 (True) → Node 7 → Node 5
2. **Path B**: Node 1 → Node 2 (True) → Node 3 → Node 6 (False) → Node 8 → Node 5
3. **Path C**: Node 1 → Node 2 (False) → Node 4 → Node 6 (True) → Node 7 → Node 5
4. **Path D**: Node 1 → Node 2 (False) → Node 4 → Node 6 (False) → Node 8 → Node 5

Now, I need to check each path for infeasibility based on the criteria mentioned.

**Path A Analysis:**
- In this path, after computing `wd2`, we take the true condition at Node 2, leading to Node 3 where `apl1` is set to `wd2 + 192`.
- Then, at Node 6, we check if `apl1 > wd3`. Since `wd3 = 15360 - apl2`, and `apl2` could be any value, it's possible that `apl1` (which is `wd2 + 192`) might or might not be greater than `wd3`.
- But since we're assuming all paths are possible unless proven otherwise, I need to see if this condition can ever hold.

**Path B Analysis:**
- Similar initial steps as Path A but takes the false branch at Node 6. Here, `apl1` is set to `-wd3`. Since `wd3 = 15360 - apl2`, and `apl2` could vary, this is feasible only if `apl1` can be less than or equal to `wd3`.

Wait a second. Let me think about the logic here.

In Node 6, the condition is `if (apl1 > wd3)`. So:

- If true: set `apl1 = wd3`
- If false: set `apl1 = -wd3`

But let's consider what `wd3` represents. It's computed as `15360 - apl2`. Depending on the value of `apl2`, `wd3` can be positive or negative.

Suppose `apl2` is a certain value that makes `wd3` very large, say 10000. Then, if `apl1` after Node 3 (which is `wd2 + 192`) is greater than 10000, Path A would take the true branch and cap `apl1` at 10000. Otherwise, it caps it at -10000.

But since `al1` can be any integer (assuming it's a signed int), `wd2` could be very large or small depending on the input. So both paths from Node 6 are possible unless certain constraints make them impossible.

Is there any scenario where, after computing `apl1`, the condition in Node 6 cannot be either true or false?

Wait, no—since for any given value of `apl1` and `wd3`, one of the conditions must hold. So both paths from Node 6 are possible.

However, I need to check if there's a contradiction in the logic that makes some paths impossible.

For example, suppose after Node 3, `apl1 = wd2 + 192`. Then, `wd3` is calculated as `15360 - apl2`. If `apl2` is such that `wd3` is less than `apl1`, then the true condition in Node 6 would cap `apl1` at `wd3`. But if `apl2` causes `wd3` to be greater than `apl1`, then it doesn't change, right?

Wait no—because in both cases, regardless of whether the condition is true or false, `apl1` gets a new value. So all paths are feasible.

Alternatively, perhaps I'm missing something about the variables involved.

Looking at Node 5: It's just a calculation of `wd3`, which depends on `apl2`. Then Nodes 7 and 8 modify `apl1` based on this.

Is there any condition where, after Node 6's decision, setting `apl1` to either `wd3` or `-wd3` is impossible?

Suppose in Node 3: `apl1 = wd2 + 192`. Then, if `wd3` is such that `apl1 > wd3`, it gets set to `wd3`. But if `wd3` is negative and `apl1` is positive, this could happen. Similarly, the other case.

I don't see any inherent contradictions here. Both paths from Node 6 are possible under different scenarios of input variables.

Wait another thought: In Node 5, `wd3` is computed as `15360 - apl2`. So if `apl2` is a certain value, `wd3` could be positive or negative.

For instance, if `apl2` is greater than 15360, `wd3` becomes negative. Then, in Node 6:

- If `apl1` (from Node 3: wd2 + 192) is a large positive number, it's possible that `apl1 > wd3` (which could be negative), making the condition true and setting `apl1 = wd3`. But since `wd3` is negative here, `apl1` would become negative. Alternatively, if `apl1` was already larger than `wd3`, perhaps because `wd2 + 192` is large.

Alternatively, if `apl2` is such that `wd3` is positive and very large, then depending on the value of `wd2`, either condition could be true or false.

So, in all cases, both branches from Node 6 are possible. Therefore, no infeasible paths here.

Wait—maybe I'm missing something else. For example, what if after setting `apl1` in Nodes 3 and 4, it's impossible for `apl1 > wd3` or not? Let me think about the relationship between these variables.

Alternatively, perhaps there are some dependencies where certain conditions must hold regardless of inputs, making some paths impossible.

Wait, let's consider that after Node 1, we have `wd2 = (al1 * 255) >> 8`. This could be any integer value depending on `al1`.

Then in Nodes 3 and 4, `apl1` is set to `wd2 + 192` or `wd2 - 192`, respectively.

Now, when we reach Node 6, the condition depends on whether `apl1 > wd3`. But `wd3 = 15360 - apl2`.

Is there a way for `apl1` to be greater than `wd3`?

It's possible if `al1` is such that `wd2` is sufficiently large, and `apl2` isn't making `wd3` too big. But without specific constraints on these variables, both possibilities are open.

Therefore, all four paths (A, B, C, D) seem to be feasible under different input scenarios.

But wait—another angle: Maybe there's a dependency where after setting `apl1` in Nodes 3 or 4, the condition in Node 6 cannot be met. For example, if `apl1` is always less than or equal to `wd3`, making Path B (and C) impossible.

Alternatively, perhaps due to how `apl2` is set elsewhere, but since we don't have the full context of where `apl2` comes from, it's hard to say. However, based on the given code snippet for `uppol1`, `apl2` isn't defined here—it must be a variable that's modified before this function is called.

Given that `apl2` could be any value, both possibilities in Node 6 are feasible.

So, upon reflection, I don't see any of these paths being infeasible. Therefore, there are no infeasible paths in the CDFG for `uppol1`.
