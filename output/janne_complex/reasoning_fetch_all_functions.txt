Okay, let me try to figure out how to approach this problem. So, the user provided a code snippet and asked me to extract only the names of all functions or methods defined by the user, ignoring built-in or library functions. They also specified some formatting rules: list each name on its own line, exactly as declared, without any bullets or numbers, and include all functions including main.

First, I need to look at the given code carefully. The code is in C. It has two functions: complex() and main(). 

Looking at the code:

The first function is int complex(int a, int b). So its name is complex. Then there's another function, int main(), which is the standard entry point for C programs.

I should make sure I capture both function names. The user wants all user-defined functions, including main. So in this case, it's two functions: complex and main.

Wait, are there any other functions? Let me scan through the code again. There's a call to complex from main, but that's just a function call, not a definition. And inside complex, there are some if-else statements and loops, but no additional function definitions. So only two functions: complex and main.

I need to list each function name on its own line, preserving the case as it appears in the code. In C, functions are usually declared with lowercase letters, so both names start with a lowercase letter.

Also, I should ignore any parameters or the body of the functions. Just the function names themselves.

So the output should be:

complex
main

That's all. No other functions defined in this code snippet.
