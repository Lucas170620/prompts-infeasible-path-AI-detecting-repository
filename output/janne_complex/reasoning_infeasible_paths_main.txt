Okay, I need to analyze the given code and its CDFG to identify infeasible paths. Let's start by understanding what each step entails.

First, let me look at the provided code. The main function initializes variables a and b to 1 and then calls the complex function with these values. The complex function has loops that modify a and b based on certain conditions. 

Now, looking at the CDFG for main. It's represented as a dot graph with nodes labeled from 1 to 4. Each node corresponds to parts of the code.

Node 1 is the start where a, b, answer are initialized. Then it calls complex(a,b) and assigns the result to answer. Then returns answer.

In the example provided, infeasible paths are found by checking logical contradictions or data dependencies. So I need to map each node to its corresponding code lines and then check possible paths for any such issues.

Looking at Node 1: It's initializing variables and calling complex(). No obvious issues here since it's just initialization.

Node 2 is the function call to complex(a, b). Since a and b are initialized before this, there shouldn't be any data dependency issues here. So this path should always be taken when the program runs, making it feasible.

Node 3 is returning answer. Again, since answer was assigned from the function call, which was done correctly, no issues here.

So now, let's think about possible paths through these nodes.

The flow is Node1 -> Node2 (function call) -> Node3 (return) -> Node4? Wait, looking at the CDFG again: It shows 1->2, 2->3, 3->4. But node 4 is a double circle, which in graphviz usually denotes an end point or sink.

Wait, perhaps the nodes are arranged as follows:

- Node1 is the starting point.
- Then it goes to Node2 (the function call).
- After that, proceeds to Node3 (return statement).
- Finally, ends at Node4, which might be a dummy end node or just an exit.

So the only path is 1->2->3->4. Since there are no conditional branches in this part of the code (the main function is very simple), there's only one possible path.

Now, checking for any contradictions: The function call to complex() is always made because a and b are initialized before it. So that condition is satisfied. There are no conditions in between, so all paths should be feasible.

Therefore, I don't see any infeasible paths here. All the nodes form a single continuous path with no branching or conflicting logic.
