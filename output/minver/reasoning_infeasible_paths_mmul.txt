Okay, I need to analyze the given mmul function and its corresponding CDFG to identify any infeasible paths. Let me start by understanding what the function does.

Looking at the code, mmul is a matrix multiplication function for 3x3 matrices. It takes four integers as parameters: row_a, col_a (dimensions of the first matrix), row_b, col_b (dimensions of the second matrix). 

The CDFG provided has several nodes labeled from 1 to 13. Each node represents either a condition or an operation in the function.

Starting with Passo 1, I need to map each node in the CDFG to the corresponding code lines. Let me go through the CDFG and see what each node does.

Node 1 seems to assign row_c = row_a and col_c = col_b. That's done at the beginning of the function. Then Node 2 checks if any of the dimensions are invalid: if row_c, row_b, or col_c is less than 1, or if col_a (which should be row_a) doesn't match row_b. If true, it returns 999.

Node 4 starts a loop for i from 0 to row_c - 1. Inside this loop, there's another loop for j from 0 to col_c -1 (Node 6). Then Node 8 initializes w to 0.0 and loops over k from 0 to row_b -1 (Nodes 9 and 12), accumulating the product of a[i][k] * b[k][j]. Finally, it assigns c[i][j] = w.

Now for Passo 2, I need to list all possible paths through the CDFG. Let's consider the main flow:

The function starts at Node 1 (initial assignments). Then it goes to Node 2 (condition check). If any condition is true (invalid dimensions), it returns 999 at Node 3. Otherwise, it proceeds to loop over i starting at Node 4.

Each iteration of i leads to a j loop starting at Node 6. For each j, w is initialized at Node 8, and the k loop starts at Node 9. After processing all k's, c[i][j] is assigned at Node 11, then back to continue with other j's (Node 12), until returning 0 at Node 13.

Now I need to check for infeasible paths. Let's see:

Looking at the conditions: The function first checks if row_c <1, which would be row_a <1. Since matrices are 3x3 in this benchmark, row_a is always 3, so row_c (which equals row_a) will never be less than 1. Similarly, col_b is 3, so col_c=col_b won't be less than 1 either. Row_b is also 3 because it's the other matrix being multiplied. So all these conditions are satisfied in this context.

Therefore, Node 2 will always evaluate to false for the given inputs. Hence, the path through Node 2 (invalid dimensions) leading to return 999 is impossible here. This makes that entire branch an infeasible path because it can never be executed with valid inputs.

Looking at other paths: All the loops are properly structured without any obvious logical contradictions. The data dependencies seem okay; all variables like i, j, k are initialized and within bounds for 3x3 matrices.

So, the only infeasible path is when Node 2's condition is true, but since our inputs always satisfy row_a=3, col_b=3, etc., this path never occurs. Thus, it's statically infeasible because it can't be executed under normal circumstances for this function.
