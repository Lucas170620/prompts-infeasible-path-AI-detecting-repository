The function minver does not contain any infeasible paths due to logical contradictions. All possible execution paths eventually lead to a valid return statement based on the initial conditions and matrix properties.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Initial Checks (Node 1):**
   - The function first verifies if `eps` is non-positive or if `row` is outside the range [2, 500]. If any condition is met, it returns 999 immediately.
   
2. **Loop Through Rows (Nodes 2-3):**
   - For each row index `k`, compute the maximum element in column `k` from row `k` to `row`. This determines the pivot row `r`.
   - Calculate the absolute value of the pivot (`api`). If `api` is less than or equal to `eps`, return 1, indicating a singular matrix within numerical precision.
   
3. **Pivot Processing (Node7):**
   - Swap elements in the work array if `r` is not equal to `k`. This step doesn't affect subsequent logic significantly but ensures proper row permutation tracking.
   
4. **Row Operations (Node8):**
   - Perform row operations using the pivot to eliminate elements below and above the diagonal, standard steps in Gaussian elimination. These operations are valid as long as `api` is greater than `eps`, ensuring a non-zero pivot.

5. **Post-Processing Loop (Node11):**
   - After all pivots are processed, permute the rows of the matrix based on the work array to reflect row swaps performed during elimination.

6. **Return Determinant and Result:**
   - The function sets `det = w1` (the product of pivots) and returns 0, indicating successful computation.

**Conclusion:**

All paths through the code either terminate early with a valid return value or proceed correctly to compute the matrix inverse under the assumption that it is non-singular within numerical precision. There are no logical contradictions or impossible conditions that would render any path infeasible beyond what's already handled by early returns.
