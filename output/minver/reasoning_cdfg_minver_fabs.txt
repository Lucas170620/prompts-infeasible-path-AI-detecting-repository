Okay, so I need to generate a Control and Data Flow Graph (CDFG) for the function minver_fabs in the provided code. Let's start by understanding what minver_fabs does.

Looking at the code, minver_fabs is a simple function that takes a double n and returns its absolute value. If n is positive or zero, it returns n; otherwise, it returns -n.

The user has specified that I should create this graph in Graphviz DOT format with specific guidelines. They provided an example, which helps clarify the requirements.

First, I'll break down the function into basic blocks and identify the control flow. The function has two main branches: one for n >= 0 and another for n < 0.

Each node in the CDFG will represent a basic block. Since this is a simple function with just an if-else statement, there should be three nodes: the entry point (where n is checked), the true branch (returning n), and the false branch (returning -n).

Next, I need to map each node to its corresponding code snippet. Node 1 will be the start where the function begins. Then, nodes 2 and 3 represent the two possible execution paths based on the condition.

For data flow, I'll note the definitions and uses of variables. In minver_fabs, 'n' is used in both conditions and calculations. The return value is defined in each branch.

I should ensure that the graph starts at node 1 and flows through either node 2 or node 3 based on the condition. Node 4 will be the exit point, marked with a double circle as it's the end of the function.

I'll structure the DOT code accordingly, setting rankdir to TB for vertical layout. Each node will have appropriate labels and shapes: circles for processing nodes and double circles for the exit.

Finally, I'll create the mapping from code snippets to their respective nodes, ensuring each part is clear and corresponds correctly in the graph.
