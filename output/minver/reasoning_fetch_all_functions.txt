Okay, so I need to analyze this code and extract the names of all user-defined functions. Let me look through it carefully.

First, I see that the main function is defined as `int main()`. That's one function.

Then, looking further down, there's a function called `minver(int row, int col, double eps)`. That's another one.

There's also `int mmul(int row_a, int col_a, int row_b, int col_b)`, which is another user-defined function.

Wait, I almost missed this. There's a function named `minver_fabs(double n)` inside the code. It's declared as static but it's still a user-defined function.

I should make sure to list all of these without missing any. Let me go through each part again.

The main function is definitely there. Then, minver, mmul, and minver_fabs are all functions defined by the user. I don't see any other functions in the code provided.

So, compiling the list: main, minver, mmul, and minver_fabs.
