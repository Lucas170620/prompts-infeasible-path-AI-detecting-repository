Okay, I need to analyze the given C code and extract all user-defined functions or methods. The user specifically wants only the names of these functions, ignoring built-in ones and parameters.

Looking at the code provided:

First, there's a function called `fabs` which is a static function. But wait, `fabs` is actually a standard library function in C, so I shouldn't include it since it's built-in.

Next, the main function is named `main`, which is a user-defined function, so that should be included.

Then, there's `ludcmp`, which is declared as an integer function. This is definitely a user-defined function, so it goes on the list.

I don't see any other functions defined in the code. The variables and loops inside these functions shouldn't affect what I'm looking for, just the function names themselves.

So, compiling the list: `main` and `ludcmp`.
