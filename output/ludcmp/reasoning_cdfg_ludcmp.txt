Okay, so I need to create a Control and Data Flow Graph (CDFG) for the function ludcmp in the provided code using Graphviz DOT format. Let me start by understanding what CDFG is. It's a hybrid graph that combines control flow and data flow information. Each node represents a basic block, and edges represent control and data dependencies.

First, I'll look at the function ludcmp. It's an implementation of LU decomposition for solving simultaneous linear equations. The code has several loops and condition checks, which will translate into nodes in the CDFG.

I'll start by identifying all the basic blocks. A basic block is a sequence of instructions with no jumps or jump targets except at the beginning and end. So I need to break down the function into these blocks.

Looking at the code:

1. The function starts by checking if n > 99 or eps <= 0, returning 999 if true.
2. Then there's a loop over i from 0 to n-1.
3. Inside this loop, for each i, it checks if a[i][i] is less than or equal to eps, returns 1 if so.
4. For each j starting from i+1 to n, it calculates w and updates a[j][i].
5. Then another loop over j from i+1 to n, updating a[i+1][j].
6. After the loops, y[0] is set to b[0], then another loop for i from 1 to n.
7. Another assignment to y[n], then a loop over i from n-1 down to 0.

Each of these steps can be broken into basic blocks, especially around conditional statements and loops.

Now, I need to map the data flow: definitions (def) and uses (c-use/p-use). For each node, I'll track what variables are defined and used computationally or predicate-wise.

Let me outline the code structure:

- Line 1: Check n >99 || eps <=0 → return
- Lines 3-4: Loop over i. Inside, check a[i][i] <= eps → return if true.
- Lines 5-7: For each j, compute w and update a[j][i].
- Lines 8-10: Compute w and update a[i+1][j].
- Lines 12-14: Compute y[i].
- Lines 16-18: Compute x[i].

Each of these sections can be nodes with their own defs and uses.

Next, I'll number each node sequentially. Each basic block will be a node, with edges showing control flow (conditions) and data dependencies.

For example:

- Node 1: Check if n >99 or eps <=0 → return.
- If not, proceed to the loop on i.

Each conditional check will split into two edges: one for true and false. For loops, I'll represent them with a node that points back to the start after processing the body.

I also need to note variable accesses (uses) in each node. For example, when accessing a[i][i], it's a c-use of a, i.

Now, considering all this, I can structure the nodes:

1. Entry
2. Check n condition → split into true (return 999) and false (continue).
3. Loop over i.
   - Inside loop: check a[i][i] <= eps → return.
   - Then process j loop.
4. For each j in inner loops, compute w.
5. Update a[j][i].
6. Compute y[0].
7. Loop over i for y.
8. Compute y[i].
9. Compute x[n].
10. Loop over i descending.
11. Compute x[i].

Each node will have labels indicating the code and dataflow info.

Finally, I'll represent this in Graphviz with nodes as circles, diamonds for decisions, and edges labeled with conditions or variable names.

I need to make sure that each loop is represented correctly, showing the control flow back to the loop condition after processing the body. Also, all defs and uses are properly noted in the xlabel of each node.
