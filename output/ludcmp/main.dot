To generate the CDFG for the `main` function provided, we need to break down the code into basic blocks and represent the control and data flows between them. Here's a structured approach:

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Identify Basic Blocks**:
   - Each block is a sequence of instructions without any jumps.
   - The main function starts with variable declarations, followed by initializing `eps`, then loops.

2. **Control Flow Nodes**:
   - Represent loop conditions and their outcomes (true/false branches).
   - Connect nodes based on the flow of execution.

3. **Data Definitions and Uses**:
   - Track when variables are defined (`def`) and used computationally or in conditions (`c-use`, `p-use`).

### CDFG Representation:

Nodes:
- Node 1: Variables declared and `eps` initialized.
- Node 2: Check if `i <=n` (outer loop).
- Node 3: Set `w = 0`.
- Node 4: Check if `j <=n` (inner loop).
- Node 5: Compute `a[i][j]`.
- Node 6: If `i == j`, multiply `a[i][j]`.
- Node 7: Add `a[i][j]` to `w`.
- Node 8: Store `w` in `b[i]`.
- Node 9: Call `ludcmp(n, eps)`.
- Node10: Return from function.

Edges:
- Node1 → Node2.
- Node2 True → Node3; False → Node9.
- Node3 → Node4.
- Node4 True → Node5; False → Node8.
- Node5 → Node6 → Node7 → Node4 (loop back).
- Node8 → Node2 (continue outer loop).
- Node9 → Node10.

### Final Answer:

The CDFG for the `main` function is structured with nodes representing each basic block and directed edges showing control flow. Each node tracks variable definitions and uses, capturing the program's logic accurately.

```code
/* This code generates a Control Flow Graph (CFG) for the given function */
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

struct Node {
    int id;
    char* label;
    int defs;
    int use;
};

void main() {
    struct Node nodes[] = {
        {1, "Start; i, j, n, chkerr, eps declared", 5, 0},
        {2, "if (i <=n) { ... }", 0, 1},
        {3, "w = 0;", 1, 0},
        {4, "for (j=0; j<=n; j++) { ... }", 0, 1},
        {5, "a[i][j] = (i+1)+(j+1);", 1, 0},
        {6, "if (i ==j) a[i][j] *=10;", 0, 2},
        {7, "w += a[i][j];", 0, 1},
        {8, "b[i] = w;", 1, 0},
        {9, "chkerr = ludcmp(n, eps);", 1, 0},
        {10, "return;", 0, 0}
    };

    // Edges representing control flow
    int edges[][] = {
        {1,2}, {2,3}, {2,9}, {4,5}, {4,8}, 
        {5,6}, {6,7}, {7,4}, {3,4}, {8,2},
        {9,10}
    };

    // Print the CFG (example format)
    for (int i = 0; i < sizeof(edges)/sizeof(int*); ++i) {
        int from = edges[i][0];
        int to = edges[i][1];
        printf("Edge: %d -> %d\n", from, to);
    }
}
```

The generated CFG accurately represents the control and data flow of the `main` function.
