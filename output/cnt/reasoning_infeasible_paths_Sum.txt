Okay, I need to analyze the given code and its CDFG to identify any infeasible paths. Let me start by understanding both the code and the CDFG provided.

First, looking at the function `Sum(matrix Array)`. This function initializes variables Ptotal, Ntotal, Pcnt, and Ncnt to zero. Then it iterates over each element of the 2D array using two nested loops: one for rows (Outer) and one for columns (Inner). For each element, it checks if the value is non-negative (due to the WORSTCASE macro being defined as checking Array[Outer][Inner] >=0).

If the condition is true, it adds the value to Ptotal and increments Pcnt. Otherwise, it adds the value to Ntotal and increments Ncnt. After processing all elements, it assigns these local totals and counts to global variables.

Now, looking at the CDFG provided as a Graphviz dot file. The nodes are labeled from 1 to 17. Each node represents a part of the code:

- Node 1 is where Ptotal, Ntotal, etc., are initialized.
- Nodes 2, 3 start the loops for Outer and Inner indices.
- Nodes 4-9 handle the conditional check on each array element.
- Nodes 10-17 manage loop increments and termination.

I need to map each node to specific lines of code. For example:

- Node 2 corresponds to the outer loop initialization: `for (Outer = 0; Outer < MAXSIZE; Outer++)`
- Node 3 is the inner loop: `for (Inner = 0; Inner < MAXSIZE; Inner++)`
- Node 4 is the if condition checking Array[Outer][Inner] >= 0.

Next, I'll list all possible paths through the CDFG. Since there are two loops and a conditional, there are multiple branches. For example:

1. From node 2, it goes to node 4 (the first element of the loop).
2. Depending on whether Array[Outer][Inner] is >=0, it takes either path from node 7 to nodes 8 or 9.
3. After processing each element, it loops back until Inner reaches MAXSIZE.

I need to check for infeasible paths based on data dependencies and logical contradictions.

One potential issue is the initialization of variables. Ptotal, Ntotal, etc., are initialized to zero at node 1. Since these are local variables, they don't retain values between function calls, so their initial state is correct.

Another point is whether the loops correctly iterate over all elements. Both Outer and Inner start at 0 and increment until less than MAXSIZE (which is 10). So, all elements should be processed.

Looking for contradictions:

In the CDFG, each element is checked exactly once per loop iteration. Since the condition is based on the current Array value, there's no contradiction as long as the loops execute correctly.

But wait, considering the WORSTCASE macro is commented out except in the Sum function. Wait, looking back at the code:

The `Sum` function has an #ifdef WORSTCASE that checks if Array[Outer][Inner] >=0 and selects the positive branch. So, in this case, for all elements, it will always take the true path of adding to Ptotal.

This might not create a logical contradiction but could affect performance analysis.

But since in this function's context, WORSTCASE is defined, every element is treated as non-negative. Thus, Ntotal and Ncnt should remain zero unless an element is negative, which doesn't happen in WORSTCASE mode.

Wait no, looking at the code:

In Sum(), #ifdef WORSTCASE is commented except for one line: checking if Array[Outer][Inner] >=0. So it's always true, so all elements are added to Ptotal and counted in Pcnt.

Therefore, in this scenario, Ntotal and Ncnt will only be incremented if the condition is false, which doesn't happen because WORSTCASE makes the condition always true.

But that doesn't create an infeasible path; it just affects the outcome. So in terms of control flow, all paths through the CDFG are feasible as per their definitions.

However, looking for possible data dependencies or loop conditions:

- Are Outer and Inner initialized correctly? Yes, both start at 0.
- Do they increment properly? Yes, with ++ after each iteration.
- Conditions check whether they're less than MAXSIZE, which is correct.

Another point: the CDFG has a node (17) that's a double circle, indicating a sink or end node. All paths should lead there correctly.

Wait, in the CDFG, nodes 5 and 6 handle the assignment of the array value to Ptotal/Ntotal based on condition. But in WORSTCASE mode, all elements are non-negative, so only the true branch is taken.

But that doesn't make any path inviable; it's just a specific execution scenario.

So, perhaps there are no infeasible paths because every possible control flow is accounted for and can be executed under some input conditions. For example, if an element is negative (which isn't forced by the WORSTCASE, but in other cases), the false branch would execute.

Wait, considering that in the CDFG, each loop iteration must process all elements, so there are no impossible paths as all branches can be taken given appropriate data.

But I need to think if any condition is unreachable. For example, is it possible for both Ptotal and Ntotal to be updated for the same element? No, because of the else clauseâ€”only one branch is executed per iteration.

Thus, in this code, all paths through the CDFG are feasible under some execution conditions.
