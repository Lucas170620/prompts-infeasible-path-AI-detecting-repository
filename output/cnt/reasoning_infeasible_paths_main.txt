Okay, so I have to analyze this given code and its CDFG to identify infeasible paths. Let me start by understanding the context.

First, looking at the main function in the code. It calls InitSeed(), then Test(Array), and finally returns 1. The CDFG provided shows nodes for these functions as well as the end of main(). Each node corresponds to a line or function call in the main.

Now, I need to map each node in the CDFG to specific parts of the code. Node 1 is InitSeed(), which initializes the Seed variable. Node 2 is Test(Array), which sets up and tests the matrix sum. Node 3 is return 1; and Node 4 is the end.

Next, identifying all possible paths through the CDFG. The main function is straightforward: it's a linear sequence from InitSeed() to Test(), then to return, ending at main()'s end. So the only path is 1 → 2 → 3 → 4.

Now, checking for infeasible paths. Since this is a simple linear flow without any conditionals or branches within the main function itself, there are no alternative paths. Each node directly leads to the next with no divergence.

Wait, but maybe I should look deeper into what each function does. For example, Test() calls Initialize(), Sum(), etc., which might have their own internal logic and possible paths. However, the CDFG provided only shows the top-level functions called from main(). So within Test(), there are more functions, but those aren't represented in this particular CDFG.

In terms of data dependencies: Seed is initialized in Node 1 (InitSeed()), which is used by RandomInteger() when initializing the matrix. But since all these calls happen correctly and the variables are properly initialized, there's no issue with uninitialized variables or contradictions.

Looking at the code flow again: main calls InitSeed(), then Test(), which does its work, and finally returns 1. There's no possibility of any other path because each function call is sequential without any conditionals in the main function itself.

So, considering all this, there are no infeasible paths in this CDFG. The flow is strictly linear with no branches or conditions that could lead to impossible execution sequences.
