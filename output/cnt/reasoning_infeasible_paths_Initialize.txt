Okay, I need to analyze the provided code and its Control Flow Data Flow Graph (CDFG) to identify any infeasible paths. Let's start by understanding what each part does.

First, looking at the code, it's a function called `InitializeMatrix` which initializes a matrix with random integers. The CDFG isn't directly given, but from the previous example, I can infer that the CDFG includes nodes for initializing loop variables, checking loop conditions, calling functions, assigning values, and control flow edges between these nodes.

The task is to identify infeasible paths. Infeasible paths are those that cannot be executed under any circumstances due to logical contradictions, data dependencies, or program invariants.

Let me break it down step by step as per the instructions.

**Step 1: Mapping Code to CDFG Nodes**

I'll map each node and edge in the CDFG to specific lines of code. For example:

- Node 2 corresponds to initializing `OuterIndex = 0` (line where this happens).
- Node 3 checks if `OuterIndex < size`.
- And so on for each node.

**Step 2: Identify Potential Paths**

I'll list all possible paths through the CDFG. Since it's a nested loop, there are multiple paths depending on whether the conditions evaluate to true or false.

For example:
- A path that always takes the outer loop and then the inner loop.
- Another path where after processing an element, both loops increment and continue until termination.

**Step 3: Classify Infeasibility**

Each potential path needs to be classified as either statically infeasible (always impossible) or dynamically infeasible (impossible under certain input conditions).

In this case, since the loops are straightforward with no conditional logic that could create contradictions beyond their natural flow, I need to check if any paths lead to logical inconsistencies.

**Step 4: Analyze Viability Criteria**

For each path:

1. **Data Consistency**: Ensure all variables used are properly initialized.
2. **Logical Flow**: Check for conditions that cannot be met together.
3. **Context Invariants**: Look for invariants (like `OuterIndex` starting at 0 and incrementing) that make certain paths impossible.
4. **Loop Conditions**: Verify that loop entry/exit conditions are satisfied.

In the given code, both loops (`for`) have clear entry and exit conditions. The outer loop runs from 0 to `size-1`, and for each iteration of the outer loop, the inner loop does the same. There's no conditional logic inside the loops except for assigning random integers, which is always valid.

**Step 5: Consolidation**

After evaluating all paths, I need to filter out those that violate any criteria as infeasible.

In this case, since all nodes and edges follow a logical flow without any conditions that can't be met (like trying to access an uninitialized variable or contradictory condition checks), there are no infeasible paths. The loops will always execute correctly based on the given `size`.

So, after this thorough analysis, I conclude that there are no infeasible paths in the provided CDFG for the `InitializeMatrix` function.
