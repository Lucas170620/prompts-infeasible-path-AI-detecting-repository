Okay, so I need to create a Control and Data Flow Graph (CDFG) for the InitSeed function in the given code using Graphviz DOT. Let me start by understanding what the InitSeed function does.

Looking at the code, InitSeed is a function that initializes a global variable called Seed. The function sets Seed = 0 and returns 0. It's quite simple, but I need to represent it accurately in the CDFG.

First, I should identify all the basic blocks and map the definitions and uses of variables. Since the function is straightforward, there are only a few steps involved.

The function starts by assigning Seed = 0. Then it returns 0. So, the first node will handle the assignment, defining the Seed variable. The second node will be the return statement.

Now, I need to consider data flow and control flow. For data flow, in the first node, there's a definition of Seed. In terms of uses, since it's an assignment, it doesn't use any other variables except possibly itself if there were side effects, but here it's just setting it to 0.

For control flow, after assigning Seed, the function proceeds to return. There are no conditional statements or loops, so the control flow is linear.

I should represent each statement as a node in the graph. Each node will have labels indicating definitions and uses. The first node (Node 1) defines Seed, and the second node (Node 2) returns, which is the end of the function.

Since there are no conditions or loops, the edges are straightforward. Node 1 points to Node 2 with a default edge since there's only one path.

I need to make sure each node has the correct labels for definitions and uses. For Node 1, it's defining Seed, and perhaps using nothing except the assignment operation. Node 2 is just returning, so it doesn't define or use any variables except maybe an implicit return value.

Now, structuring the DOT code: I'll create a digraph named InitSeed. Nodes will be numbered sequentially. Each node will have a shape of circle, and the final node (Node 2) will have a doublecircle to indicate the end.

Edges are simple here, just from Node 1 to Node 2 with no condition since it's a straight line.

For the mapping part, each node should correspond to the code snippet. So, Node 1 corresponds to Seed = 0; and Node 2 corresponds to return 0;

Putting it all together, I think that covers the necessary parts. Now, I'll structure the DOT code accordingly and provide the mapping.
