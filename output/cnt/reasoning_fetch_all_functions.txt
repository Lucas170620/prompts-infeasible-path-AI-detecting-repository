Alright, I need to analyze the provided C code and extract only the names of all user-defined functions or methods. I should ignore any built-in or library functions. The output should list each function name on a new line, preserving their case, without any numbers, bullets, or extra characters. Also, I must include all functions, including main.

First, I'll go through the code step by step to identify each function.

Looking at the code:

1. There's a comment block with some identifiers and definitions.
2. The first function I see is `main()`, which is declared as `int main(void)`. So that's one function.
3. Next, inside `Test(matrix Array)`, but before that, there are several functions declared at the top:
   - `int Test(matrix);`
   - `int Initialize(matrix);`
   - `int InitSeed();`
   - `void Sum(matrix);`
   - `int RandomInteger(void);`

4. Then, in the code body, each of these functions is defined. For example, `Test()` calls `Initialize()`, which in turn initializes an array with random integers using `RandomInteger()`. The `Sum()` function calculates totals and counts.

5. There's also a commented-out part about timing, but it references `ttime()`, which isn't defined in the provided code, so I can ignore that.

So, listing each function:

- main
- Test
- Initialize
- InitSeed
- Sum
- RandomInteger

I should make sure I didn't miss any. Let me check again.

Wait, looking at the code, there's also a `ttime()` function commented out, but since it's not defined in the user's code, I shouldn't include it. The other functions are all user-defined and declared with `int` or `void`, so they should be included.

Yes, that's all of them.
