Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze the given code and its CDFG to identify infeasible paths. Let me start by understanding what's provided.

First, there's a function called `InitSeed()` which initializes a global variable `Seed` to 0 and returns 0. The CDFG provided is a simple graph with two nodes: node 1 represents the assignment `Seed = 0;`, and node 2 is the return statement `return 0;`. There's an edge from node 1 to node 2.

Now, I need to follow the steps outlined in the task. Let me go through each step methodically.

**Passo 1: Mapeamento Código-CDFG**

I'll map each node and edge in the CDFG to specific lines of code in `InitSeed()`.

- Node 1 has the label "Def: Seed\nC-Use: none", which corresponds to line where `Seed` is initialized. Looking at the code, that's line 5: `Seed = 0;`.
- Node 2 is a double circle with the label "Return", corresponding to the return statement in line 6: `return 0;`.

The edge from node 1 to node 2 represents the flow after initializing `Seed` and returning.

**Passo 2: Identificação de Caminhos Potenciais**

Looking at the CDFG, there's only one possible path: Node 1 -> Node 2. So the potential paths are straightforward here—just this single sequence.

**Passo 3: Classificação de Inviabilidade**

I need to determine if this path is feasible or not. Since both nodes represent valid operations that always execute in order, there's no logical contradiction here. The function initializes `Seed` and then returns, which is a normal flow.

But wait, let me think again. Is there any condition that could make this path inviable? Well, since it's a straightforward assignment followed by return, under all possible executions, this path will always be taken. There are no conditional branches or alternative paths here.

So, the only path is the one that goes from Node 1 to Node 2. Since both steps are mandatory and there's no condition preventing them, this path is not infeasible.

**Passo 4: Análise de Viabilidade por Critério**

Let me apply each criterion to check for infeasibility:

1. **Dados**: The variable `Seed` is properly initialized before being used (or returned). There's no issue with uninitialized variables here.
2. **Lógica**: No conditions are checked; the function just does its job without any conditional statements that could lead to contradictions.
3. **Contexto**: The function doesn't depend on external conditions beyond what's provided. It's a standalone initializer.
4. **Loop**: There are no loops involved, so this isn't a concern.

Since none of these criteria indicate an issue, the path is viable.

**Passo 5: Consolidação**

After evaluating all criteria, there are no infeasible paths because every possible execution follows the only available path without any contradictions or issues.
