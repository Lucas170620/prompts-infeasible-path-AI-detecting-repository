Okay, I need to create a Control and Data Flow Graph (CDFG) for the Test function in the given C code using Graphviz DOT notation. The goal is to represent both control flow and data flow accurately.

First, I'll look at the Test function:

int Test(matrix Array)
{
   long StartTime, StopTime;
   float TotalTime;

   Initialize(Array);
   StartTime = 1000.0; 
   Sum(Array);
   StopTime = 1500.0; 
   TotalTime = (StopTime - StartTime) / 1000.0;

   return 0;
}

The function initializes the array, records the start and stop times, calculates total time, and returns 0.

I'll break down each step into nodes:

1. **Initialization**: Variables StartTime, StopTime, TotalTime are declared.
2. **Function Call**: Initialize(Array) is called. This is a basic block where variables are used.
3. **Set StartTime**: Assigning value to StartTime.
4. **Call Sum**: Calls Sum(Array), which processes the array.
5. **Set StopTime**: Assigning value to StopTime.
6. **Calculate TotalTime**: Computes the elapsed time.
7. **Return 0**: Ends the function.

Next, I'll identify data flow:
- Variables like Array are used in Initialize and Sum functions.
- StartTime and StopTime are defined in their assignments and used later.

For control flow, each statement is a node connected sequentially except for loops or conditionals. Since there are none here, it's a linear flow.

I'll assign each basic block a node ID and map the code to these nodes.

Finally, I'll create the DOT structure with nodes and edges, ensuring shapes and labels reflect processing steps. Each node will have its definition and usage of variables as annotations.
