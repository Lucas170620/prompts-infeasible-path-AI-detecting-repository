Okay, I need to generate a Control and Data Flow Graph (CDFG) in Graphviz DOT format for the function RandomInteger provided in the code. Let me start by understanding what this function does.

Looking at the code:

int RandomInteger(void)
{
   Seed = ((Seed * 133) + 81) % 8095;
   return Seed;
}

This function takes no arguments and returns an integer. It modifies the global variable 'Seed'. The function performs three operations:
1. Multiply Seed by 133.
2. Add 81 to the result.
3. Take modulo 8095 of the sum, then assign it back to Seed.
4. Return the updated Seed.

I'll need to break this down into nodes and edges for the CDFG. Let's plan each step.

First, the function starts by using the current value of Seed. So there's a use of Seed here. Then, it performs arithmetic operations on it. Finally, it returns the new value.

Since all steps are sequential without any branches or loops, this should be straightforward. Each operation can be a node in the graph.

I'll number each node sequentially:

1. The initial access to Seed (use).
2. Multiply by 133.
3. Add 81.
4. Modulo operation with 8095.
5. Assignment of the result back to Seed (defining it).
6. Return statement, which uses Seed again.

Wait, but in terms of control flow, each step is a single node since there are no branches. Each operation leads directly to the next.

Let me structure the nodes:

Node 1: Accessing Seed for multiplication.
Node 2: Multiply Seed by 133.
Node 3: Adding 81.
Node 4: Taking modulo 8095 and assigning back to Seed.
Node 5: Return statement, accessing Seed again.

But perhaps each basic operation should be a node. So:

- Node 1: Start with Seed's value (use).
- Node 2: Multiply by 133 (operation on data from Node 1).
- Node 3: Add 81 to the result of Node 2.
- Node 4: Compute modulo 8095 and assign back to Seed (defining it).
- Node 5: Return statement, using Seed's new value.

Wait, but in code, these are done in sequence without any jumps. So each step is a node connected sequentially.

But perhaps the multiplication, addition, and modulo can be considered as separate nodes, each performing an operation on the data from the previous step.

So:

Node 1: Use of Seed for multiplication (C-Use).
Node 2: Multiply by 133.
Node 3: Use result from Node 2 and add 81.
Node 4: Use result from Node 3 and compute modulo 8095, then assign back to Seed (defining it as a def node).
Node 5: Return statement, using the new Seed value (C-Use).

But since each operation is sequential without any conditionals or loops, the graph should be linear.

Now, mapping this into nodes:

1. Start: accessing Seed for multiplication.
2. Multiply by 133 and store in a temporary variable? Or just compute it as part of the sequence.
Wait, the code doesn't use a temporary variable; it's all done inline.

Hmm, perhaps each arithmetic operation is a node that transforms the data from the previous step.

So:

Node 1: Use Seed (C-Use) for multiplication.
Edge to Node 2.

Node 2: Multiply by 133. This is a computational use of 133 and the result from Node 1.

Wait, but 133 is a constant; perhaps it's not part of the data flow but an input to the operation.

Alternatively, since we're focusing on variables and their uses/defs, constants may be considered as literals and don't need nodes unless they are variables.

So for each step:

Node 1: Seed is read (C-Use).
Node 2: Multiply by 133. This is a computational use of the value from Node 1 and the constant 133.
But since 133 isn't a variable, perhaps it's part of the operation without needing a separate node.

Wait, maybe I'm overcomplicating. Each step in the function can be represented as nodes:

Node 1: Start with Seed (use).
Node 2: Multiply by 133.
Node 3: Add 81 to result.
Node 4: Modulo 8095 and assign back to Seed (defining it).
Node 5: Return the value of Seed.

But each operation is done in sequence, so nodes are connected as 1->2->3->4->5.

Wait, but Node 2 uses the result from Node 1. So:

1. Use Seed (C-Use) → computational use for multiplication.
2. Multiply by 133 (computational node).
3. Add 81 to the result of step 2.
4. Take modulo 8095 and assign back to Seed (defining it).
5. Return Seed.

Alternatively, each operation is a node that takes data from the previous node and applies an operation, then defines new variables as needed.

But considering that 'Seed' is modified in step 4, which is a definition, and used again in step 5.

Wait, perhaps:

Node 1: Read Seed (C-Use).
Edge to Node 2.
Node 2: Multiply by 133 → this is a computational use of the value from Node 1. So C-Use of Seed, P-Use of 133? Or since 133 is a constant, perhaps not tracked.

Wait, according to the specifications, I need to track both C-uses and P-uses. Constants would be part of P-uses because they are used in conditions or expressions, but in this case, 133 is an operand in a multiplication, which is a computational use.

But maybe constants don't have definitions, only uses. So perhaps for each operation involving variables, we track their defs and uses.

So:

Node 1: Seed is read (C-Use).
Node 2: Multiply by 133 → this is a C-Use of the result from Node 1.
But wait, the multiplication doesn't define anything yet; it's just an intermediate step. So perhaps the result is stored in a temporary variable or kept in a register, but since we're not using variables, maybe each operation is part of the same node.

Alternatively, considering that all operations are done on the stack implicitly, each step can be considered as modifying the data flow without explicit variables.

This is getting a bit tricky. Let me try to model it step by step.

The function has two main steps: updating Seed and returning it.

Let's consider each operation:

1. Read Seed (C-Use).
2. Compute new value as (Seed * 133 + 81) % 8095.
   a. Multiply Seed by 133 → uses the value from step 1.
   b. Add 81 to the result of multiplication.
   c. Take modulo 8095 of the sum and assign back to Seed.

So each part can be split into nodes:

Node 1: Use Seed for multiplication (C-Use).
Node 2: Multiply by 133 → C-Use of Node 1's value and the constant 133. But since 133 is a literal, maybe it's a P-Use? Or perhaps not tracked as a use.

Wait, according to the problem statement, we need to track def, c-use (computational), and p-use (predicate). Constants would be considered as part of p-uses when used in conditions, but here they are used in arithmetic operations. So in this case, 133 is a computational operand, which is a C-Use.

But since 133 isn't a variable, perhaps it's not tracked as a use. Hmm, I'm not sure. Maybe only variables are considered for def and use tracking.

If that's the case, then:

Node 1: Use Seed (C-Use).
Edge to Node 2.
Node 2: Multiply by 133 → C-Use of Seed from Node 1.
But wait, multiplication is an operation that uses both operands. So perhaps:

In Node 2, we have two inputs: the result from Node 1 and the constant 133.

But since constants aren't variables, maybe they're not part of def/use tracking.

This complicates things. Alternatively, perhaps each arithmetic operation is a node that takes the previous value as input and produces a new value without introducing any new variable definitions except for Seed at the end.

So:

Node 1: Use Seed → C-Use.
Edge to Node 2: Multiply by 133 (using the result from Node 1) → computational use of Seed.
Edge to Node 3: Add 81 (computational use from Node 2).
Edge to Node 4: Modulo 8095 and assign back to Seed → defining it.
Edge to Node 5: Return statement, which uses the new value of Seed.

But this seems a bit flat. Alternatively, perhaps each step is a separate node:

1. Read Seed (C-Use).
2. Multiply by 133 (computational use of Seed's value from step 1).
3. Add 81 to result (computational use of the value from step 2).
4. Compute modulo 8095 and assign back to Seed (defining it, using the value from step 3).
5. Return statement, which uses Seed's new value (C-Use).

Each node is connected in a straight line: 1→2→3→4→5.

Now, for each node:

Node 1:
- Shape: box
- Label: "Read Seed"
- xlabel: C-Use of Seed

Node 2:
- Shape: box
- Label: "Multiply by 133"
- xlabel: C-Use of result from Node 1 and constant 133 (but maybe only Seed is relevant)

Wait, but the multiplication is between the value of Seed and 133. Since 133 isn't a variable, perhaps it's not included in the def/use tracking.

Alternatively, for computational nodes, we can note that they use variables and constants as part of their operation, but only variables are tracked.

So Node 2 would have:

- xlabel: C-Use (Seed from Node 1)

Similarly, Node 3:

- Label: "Add 81"
- xlabel: C-Use of result from Node 2

Node 4:

- Label: "Modulo 8095 and assign to Seed"
- xlabel: Defining Seed using result from Node 3

Node 5:

- Label: "Return"
- xlabel: C-Use of Seed (defined in Node 4)

Each node is connected in a straight line.

Wait, but the modulo operation also uses 8095 as a constant. Again, since it's not a variable, perhaps only Seed's def and use are tracked.

So putting it all together:

Nodes:

1: Start → C-Use of Seed
2: Multiply by 133 → C-Use of result from 1
3: Add 81 → C-Use of result from 2
4: Modulo 8095 and assign to Seed → Defining Seed using result from 3
5: Return → C-Use of Seed (defined in 4)

Edges: 1→2→3→4→5.

Now, considering that each node is a step, the graph would be linear.

But let me think about whether there are any branches or conditions. No, it's all sequential.

So now, to model this in the CDFG:

Each node represents an operation on data, tracking def and uses of variables.

Thus, the nodes would be as follows:

Node 1: Use Seed (C-Use)
Node 2: Multiply by 133 (C-Use of result from Node 1)
Node 3: Add 81 (C-Use of result from Node 2)
Node 4: Modulo 8095 and assign to Seed (Defining it)
Node 5: Return statement (C-Use of Seed)

But perhaps the modulo operation is part of the assignment, so maybe Nodes 3 and 4 are combined into one step.

Alternatively, considering that each arithmetic operation can be a node:

1. Use Seed → C-Use
2. Multiply by 133 → C-Use (using result from 1)
3. Add 81 → C-Use (using result from 2)
4. Modulo 8095 and assign to Seed → Defining it using result from 3
5. Return → C-Use of Seed

This seems logical.

So each node is a step in the computation, with data flowing sequentially.

Now, considering that all nodes are connected linearly without any branches or loops, the graph would be simple.

In terms of def and use:

Node 1: Use (C) of Seed.
Node 2: Compute multiplication using result from Node 1 → C-Use.
Node 3: Add 81 to result from Node 2 → C-Use.
Node 4: Modulo operation, then assign back to Seed → Defining it.
Node 5: Return the value of Seed → Use (C) of the new value.

So in the graph, each node is a rectangle connected by edges.

Now, for the code:

I need to represent this as nodes and edges. Since all are sequential, it's straightforward.

But perhaps I should also consider that after Node 4, the value is stored back into Seed, which is then used in Node 5.

So yes, Node 4 defines Seed, which is used in Node 5.

Thus, the graph will have nodes 1-5 connected as a chain.

Now, let me think about any possible optimizations or alternative representations. But given that all steps are necessary and there's no branching, this should be the correct approach.
