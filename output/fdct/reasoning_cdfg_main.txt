Okay, I need to create a hybrid Control and Data Flow Graph (CDFG) in Graphviz DOT format for the provided main function. The function calls another function `fdct`, which is quite complex with loops and conditionals. Let me start by understanding the code structure.

First, looking at the main function:

1. It declares an int variable i but doesn't use it.
2. Calls `fdct(block, 8);`
3. Has a conditional compilation block that prints elements of the block array if IO is defined.
4. Returns `block[0]`.

The `fdct` function is where most of the logic happens. It processes an 8x8 block, likely for image compression like JPEG. The function has two main parts: processing rows and then columns.

In `fdct`, there are:
- Loops over rows (i from 0 to 7) with some conditional jumps.
- Then loops over columns (j from 0 to 7), again with conditionals.

Each loop iteration processes elements of the block array, which is a 2D array. The function uses variables like i, j, temp, and others for calculations.

To construct the CDFG:
- I'll need to identify each basic block.
- Track variable definitions (def) and uses (c-use/p-use).
- Represent control flow with nodes and edges, including loops and conditionals.

Starting with the main function:

Node 1: Declares i but doesn't use it. Then calls `fdct`.
- Def: i
- C-Use: none since it's unused.
- P-Use: none for conditions.

Then after `fdct`, there's a printf statement inside an #ifdef IO block, which is optional.

After that, returns block[0].

Now, focusing on the `fdct` function:

The function has loops and conditionals. Let's break it down step by step.

First loop (i from 0 to 7):

Inside this loop:
- There are two if conditions checking if i is 0 or 7.
- Then another loop for j from 0 to 7 with similar checks on j.
- Inside the inner loop, more conditionals and array accesses.

Each of these loops and conditionals will be separate nodes in the CDFG. I'll need to represent each basic block as a node, showing data flow (variable uses) and control flow (edges with conditions).

For example:

- Node for i=0 check: if (i == 0), which is a decision point.
- If true, execute some code; else, skip.

Each time variables are used or defined, I'll note them in the node's xlabel.

I also need to handle loops correctly by creating nodes that represent the loop condition and connect back to the start if false.

Given the complexity, each loop iteration will have multiple basic blocks. Each of these blocks will be a separate node with their respective def and use information.

Finally, after processing all loops, `fdct` returns, which connects back to main's return statement.

I'll proceed by numbering each node sequentially as I identify them, ensuring that control flow is correctly represented with edges labeled by conditions or data movements.
