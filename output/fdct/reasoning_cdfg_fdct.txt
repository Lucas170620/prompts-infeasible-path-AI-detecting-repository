Okay, I need to generate a hybrid Control and Data Flow Graph (CDFG) for the given fdct function using Graphviz DOT. The user has provided specific instructions on how to structure this graph, including nodes for control flow, data flow, and their uses.

First, I'll start by understanding the fdct function. It's an 8x8 discrete cosine transform function. Looking at the code, it has nested loops and conditional checks. My task is to break down each part of the function into basic blocks, identify variables' definitions and uses, and then map these to nodes in the graph.

I'll go through the code step by step:

1. The function starts with initializing some constants like W11, W12, etc. These are straightforward assignments.
2. Then there's a loop for u from 0 to 7. Inside this loop, another loop for v from 0 to 7. This is a double nested loop structure.
3. Within the inner loops, there are more variables being calculated and conditionals based on u and v values.
4. Each conditional block will be a separate basic block with its own nodes.

I need to identify each basic block, assign them sequential numbers, and then connect them with edges representing control flow. For data flow, I'll note where variables are defined (def) and used (c-use or p-use for conditions).

For example, the outer loop starts at u=0. The node will represent the assignment of u to 0. Then, there's a condition checking if u <=7. If true, it proceeds; otherwise, it exits.

Each time a variable is used in a condition (like u++ or v++), that becomes a p-use. When a variable is assigned a new value, that's a def.

I'll need to carefully track each assignment and conditional statement, creating nodes for each operation and linking them appropriately with edges labeled by their conditions.

After mapping all the code into nodes, I'll ensure the graph accurately reflects both control and data flows, using shapes like boxes for processing steps, diamonds for decisions, and double circles for terminations.

Finally, I'll prepare the Graphviz DOT code, making sure to number each node sequentially and include the necessary edge labels. Then, I'll create a separate section listing each node with its corresponding code snippet and uses.
