Okay, let's see. I need to analyze the given code and its CDFG to identify infeasible paths. First, I'll try to understand both the code and the CDFG provided.

Looking at the code, it's a main function that calls fdct with the block array and an argument of 8. Then, if IO is defined, it prints some values of the block array. Finally, it returns block[0]. 

The CDFG has several nodes labeled from 1 to 11, each representing parts of the code. The nodes are connected by edges showing the control flow.

Starting with Node 1: It's an integer declaration for i. Then Node 2 is the call to fdct(block,8). Node3 checks if IO is defined, which probably controls whether to print or not. Node4 is a loop starting with for(i=0;...), so that would be where the printing happens inside the loop.

Now, looking at possible paths through the CDFG:

1. Path 1: Node1 -> Node2 (call fdct). Then, since IO is defined in Node3, it would go to Node9. From there, into the for loop starting at Node4, then inside that, it prints and increments i. Finally, after the loop, returns block[0] as per Node6.

But wait, are there any other paths? For example, what if IO is not defined? Let's check: The condition in Node3 is an #ifdef IO directive. So, if IO isn't defined, that entire block is skipped. Therefore, the code would proceed to return block[0] without printing anything.

Now, looking for infeasible paths:

- One possible path is through Node8 after returning from the loop. Let's see: After the for loop (Node4), it goes to Node10 which checks if IO is defined again? Or perhaps I'm misreading the nodes. 

Wait, let me map each node correctly based on the code:

- Node 1: int i;
- Node2: fdct(block,8);
- Node3: #ifdef IO
- Node4: for loop
- Node5: printf statement inside the loop
- Node6: return block[0];
So in the CDFG, after the call to fdct (Node2), there's a condition whether IO is defined. If yes (Node3 -> True), then it enters the for loop starting at Node4, which includes the print statements. After the loop, regardless of IO, the function returns block[0].

So possible paths:

1. Node1 -> Node2 -> Node9 (if IO is not defined). Then directly to Node6.

2. Node1 -> Node2 -> Node3 (IO is defined) -> Node4 -> ... through the for loop, then to Node6.

Looking at whether any conditions inside could cause infeasibility.

In the for loop, i starts at 0 and increments until i <8. Inside, it prints block[i] and block[i+1]. Since i goes up to 7 (since when i=7, i<8 is true), but then i+1 becomes 8 which is within the array bounds if it's size 64.

So no issues there. All the variables are properly initialized: i starts at 0, block is passed from main and should be valid since it's declared earlier.

Now checking for any logical contradictions:

In Node3, #ifdef IO is a preprocessing directive, not an actual condition in runtime. So during compilation, if IO isn't defined, that code is skipped. Therefore, the control flow after fdct depends on whether IO is defined.

So possible paths are feasible as long as the preprocessor defines IO or not. Thus, both paths (IO defined and IO undefined) are possible depending on build flags.

Is there any condition inside loops or if statements that could cause a contradiction? Let's see:

After calling fdct, it proceeds to print if IO is defined. Inside the loop, i increments correctly, no issues with variable usages.

Therefore, all paths seem feasible because they depend solely on whether IO is defined at compile time, and the code inside each branch doesn't have any logical contradictions or undefined variables.

Hence, there are no infeasible paths because all possible execution flows are valid under their respective conditions.
