To analyze the given function `fdct` and its CDFG for infeasible paths, we systematically map each node to corresponding code lines and trace control flow. 

### Analysis of Infeasible Paths:

1. **Mapping Code-CDFG**: Nodes represent static constants (Node 1), loop starts (Nodes 2 & 45), variable definitions (e.g., Node 34 defines 'g'), and conditionals.

2. **Potential Infeasible Paths**:
   - **Contradictory Conditions**: 
     - If a path requires both `u == 0` (Node 27) and `u > 7`, it's impossible since `u` loops from 0 to 7.
   - **Data Dependencies**:
     - If a variable is used before assignment in certain paths, e.g., if Node 26 (def 'e') isn't executed but 'e' is later referenced.

3. **Classification**:
   - **Statically Inviability**: Impossible under any circumstances, e.g., `u > 7` when `u` â‰¤7.
   - **Dynamically Inviability**: Occurs only under specific inputs, like `v <4` being false for all `v`.

### Conclusion:

The function `fdct` contains infeasible paths due to logical contradictions and data dependencies. Specifically, paths requiring conditions that can't coexist (e.g., `u > 7`) or using uninitialized variables are infeasible.
