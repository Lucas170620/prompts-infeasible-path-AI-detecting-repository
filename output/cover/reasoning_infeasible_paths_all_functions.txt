Alright, I'm trying to understand how to analyze the given C program to identify infeasible paths using Control Data Flow Graphs (CDFGs). The program consists of three functions: `swi10`, `swi50`, and `swi120`, each containing a for loop with a switch statement, followed by a `main` function that calls these functions sequentially.

First, I'll look at the `swi120` function. It loops from 0 to 119. Inside the loop, there's a switch statement that increments `c` for each case from 0 to 119 and decrements it in the default case (which doesn't occur here since all cases up to 119 are covered). So, for every iteration, `c` is incremented.

The CDFG for `swi120` would have nodes representing the entry point, the loop condition check (`i < 120`), the switch case (which always increments `c`), the increment of `i`, and the exit node. The edges represent the flow between these nodes.

Now, considering infeasible paths: since `i` starts at 0 and is incremented each time, the loop will always execute as long as `i < 120`. So, the path where the condition fails (leading to an early return) is impossible because `i` will never be >=120 until after all iterations. Therefore, any path that tries to exit before completing all loops is infeasible.

Moving on to `swi50`, it's similar but loops only 50 times. Again, every case from 0 to 49 increments `c`. The default case isn't hit, so the condition `i < 50` will always be true until the loop completes. Thus, the path where the condition fails mid-loop is infeasible.

The `swi10` function loops 10 times, incrementing `c` each time. Again, since all cases are covered, any early exit based on a false loop condition is impossible.

Finally, the `main` function calls these three functions in sequence. Since each function's loop is fully executed given their respective iteration counts, there are no opportunities for infeasible paths within the function calls themselves. However, if any of the functions were to return before completing all iterations due to some condition, that could introduce infeasible paths.

In summary, the only infeasible paths identified would be those attempting to exit the loops prematurely based on false conditions, which are logically impossible given the loop's structure.
