Okay, so I need to analyze this code and extract only the names of all user-defined functions or methods. The rules say to list each name on a new line, exactly as declared, ignoring built-in functions. Also, I should include all functions, including main.

Looking at the provided code, I see several function definitions. Let me go through them one by one.

First, there's the swi120 function. It takes an integer c and loops from 0 to 119, using a switch statement for each case. Each case increments c except for the default which decrements it. So that's definitely a user-defined function.

Next, there's swi50, which works similarly but loops up to 49 instead of 119. Again, each case increments c, and the default decrements. Another user-defined function.

Then, swi10 does the same but only loops from 0 to 9. So that's a third function.

Finally, there's the main function. It calls the three functions mentioned above in sequence: first swi10 on cnt, then swi50, then swi120. So main is definitely a user-defined function as well.

I should list all these functions exactly as their names appear. That includes 'swi120', 'swi50', 'swi10', and 'main'. I need to make sure each is on its own line without any additional formatting or numbers.
