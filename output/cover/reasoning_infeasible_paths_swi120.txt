Okay, so I need to analyze the given C code and its Control Flow Data Flow Graph (CDFG) to identify any infeasible paths. The user provided both the code and a sample CDFG structure. Let me start by understanding what each part does.

Looking at the code, there are three functions: swi10, swi50, and swi120. These functions seem to modify the 'cnt' variable in sequence. Each function is called with the result of the previous one as an argument.

The main function calls these three functions in order:

cnt = swi10(cnt);
cnt = swi50(cnt);
cnt = swi120(cnt);

Each of these functions seems to have a loop that runs multiple times, modifying 'c' (which is actually passed by value, so it's a local variable in each function). Wait, no—actually, looking closer, the functions take an integer and return an integer. So each function probably increments 'cnt' based on their loops.

But wait, the code provided for swi120 shows that inside the loop, there's a switch statement with case 0 to 99. But since it's in C, each case is handled by defaulting to some operation—though without seeing the exact code of these functions, I'm assuming they all just increment 'c' (which is a local variable) multiple times.

The main function then returns the final cnt value after these three functions have modified it.

Now, the user provided a CDFG for swi120. Let me think about how this would look in terms of control flow. The entry node starts, checks if i < 120 (assuming that's the loop condition). If true, processes the switch statement which increments 'c', then increments 'i' and loops back. If false, exits.

Wait, but in the CDFG provided by the user, it's a simplified version for swi120:

- Entry node 1
- Check if i < 120 (node 2)
- c++ operation (node 3)
- i++ operation (node4)
- Return node5.

Edges: 1->2, 2->3 [true], 2->5 [false], 3->4, 4->2.

So in the CDFG for swi120, it's a simple loop structure with entry, condition check, process (c++), increment i, and then loop back or exit.

Now, the task is to analyze this code and its CDFG to find any infeasible paths. Since each function seems straightforward—incrementing 'cnt' multiple times based on loops—I need to see if there are any impossible control flow paths.

But wait, let me look more carefully at each step.

Starting with swi10: It's likely a loop that runs 10 times (i from 0 to 9), each time doing some operation. Similarly, swi50 runs 50 times and swi120 runs 120 times.

Each function probably modifies 'cnt' as follows:

For example, in swi10(cnt):
int c = cnt;
for (int i=0; i<10; i++) {
   switch(i) { ... }
}
return c;

But without the exact code, I'm assuming that each iteration increments 'c'. So for each function, it's just adding 1 to 'cnt' multiple times.

Now, looking at the CDFG provided by the user:

It has nodes labeled Entry (1), loop condition check (2), c++ operation (3), i++ (4), and return (5).

The edges are:
- Entry -> 2
- 2 -> 3 [if true]
- 2 -> 5 [if false]
- 3 ->4
- 4->2

So, the flow is:

1. Start at entry.
2. Check if i < 120.
   - If yes: go to c++ (node3)
   - If no: exit (node5)
3. After c++, increment i and loop back.

Now, I need to see if any paths in this CDFG are infeasible.

Potential paths:

Path 1: Entry ->2->3->4->2 ... (looping until i >=120)

Path 2: Entry->2->5 (exit on first iteration)

But wait, for the loop to exit at the first check, 'i' must be >=120. But in swi120, the loop initializes 'i' as 0, so the first condition is always true.

Wait a second—the function probably starts with i=0 and runs while i<120. So on the first iteration, i=0 <120: true, process c++, then i becomes 1, loop again. This continues until i=119, then increments to 120 and exits.

So in this case, is there a path where the condition fails immediately?

No, because when you enter the loop, i starts at 0, which is less than 120. So the exit on false (path Entry->5) is never taken except after all iterations are done.

Wait, but how does the function terminate? It must have a loop that runs exactly 120 times. The CDFG seems to model this correctly.

So in terms of control flow:

- The only way to reach node5 (return) is when i >=120 after incrementing. So for all practical purposes, the false edge from node2 (i<120?) will never be taken except at the end.

But wait—could there be a case where i is not initialized properly? For example, if 'i' was not set to 0 before entering the loop, then perhaps the condition could fail immediately. But in the code, each function likely initializes 'i' correctly.

Looking back at the CDFG:

Node2 represents "i <120?" which is a diamond node (condition). The true edge leads to processing c++, then i++. So each time through the loop, it's guaranteed that after processing, i is incremented and checked again.

So what about possible infeasible paths?

In this CDFG, there are two main control flow possibilities:

1. Entry ->2->3 (c++) ... looping until exit.
2. Entry->2->5 (exit immediately), but as discussed earlier, that's only possible if i starts at >=120, which is not the case.

Thus, the path from Entry to 5 directly is infeasible because 'i' is initialized to 0, making the condition true on the first check. Therefore, this edge (Entry->5) would never be executed in a correct program.

But wait—does the function actually have an exit before the loop? Let me think: The code probably starts with for(int i=0; i<120; i++) {...}, so 'i' is initialized to 0, condition checked each time. So the first check will always be true because 0 <120.

So in this case, the edge from node2 (the loop condition) to node5 (exit) with label "False" would never be taken except possibly during the last iteration where i becomes 120 after incrementing. But that's handled by the loop correctly.

Wait, but when i is 119: check i<120 (true), process c++, then i increments to 120, and next time the condition checks 120 <120? Which is false, leading to exit.

So in this case, the only way node5 can be reached is via a false condition after processing. So that path exists but is taken exactly once at the end of the loop.

But if someone modifies the code so that 'i' starts at 120 or higher before entering the loop, then the initial check would be false, leading to an immediate exit. But in the correct code, this isn't possible.

So for a correct program, is there any path that's infeasible?

In the CDFG provided by the user, the only edge that leads directly to node5 is when i >=120 on the first check, which is impossible if 'i' starts at 0. Therefore, that path (Entry->2->5) is infeasible.

So now, let's map this:

- Node1: Entry
- Node2: condition "i <120?"
   - True edge to node3 (c++)
   - False edge to node5 (return)

In the code, during the first iteration, 'i' is 0, so the true edge is taken. The false edge would only be taken after the last iteration when i becomes 120.

So, for any other scenario where 'i' isn't initialized properly, that path could be possible, but in correct execution, it's not.

Thus, this represents a static infeasible path because under all executions (assuming proper initialization), the condition on the first check is always true. Therefore, the false edge from node2 to node5 is infeasible statically.

So, the infeasible paths are:

1. Entry -> node2 -> exit (node5) without entering the loop. This is impossible because 'i' starts at 0.
