Okay, I need to create a hybrid Control and Data Flow Graph (CDFG) for the function do_tripledes_encrypt using Graphviz DOT format. Let me start by understanding what this function does.

Looking at the code provided, the function do_tripledes_encrypt is part of some cryptographic library, specifically handling Triple DES encryption. The function seems to take a context structure and encrypts data using ECB mode.

The function's implementation is straightforward: it calls tripledes_ecb_encrypt with the context, input buffer, and output buffer.

So, breaking it down:

1. **Function Definition**: It's a static function named do_tripledes_encrypt that takes two pointers to bytes (outbuf and inbuf) and a pointer to a struct _tripledes_ctx called ctx.
2. **Function Body**: Inside the function, there's a single line calling tripledes_ecb_encrypt with the context, inbuf, and outbuf.

Now, I need to model this as a CDFG. Since the function is simple, it should have few nodes.

**Nodes Identification**:
- Node 1: The function entry point where variables are initialized.
- Node 2: The call to tripledes_ecb_encrypt.
- Node 3: The return from the function (exit).

But wait, looking more closely, the function doesn't do much besides calling another function. So maybe it's even simpler.

Let me think about data flow and control flow:

- **Control Flow**: The function starts, calls the encrypt function, then exits. There are no conditionals or loops, so it's a linear flow.
- **Data Flow**: The function uses ctx, inbuf, and outbuf. These variables are passed to tripledes_ecb_encrypt.

So, each node will represent these steps:

1. Start: No operation except setting up the call.
2. Call to encrypt: This is the main operation.
3. Exit: After returning from the call.

Each node should be labeled with their respective code lines and data flow information.

Now, mapping this into Graphviz:

- Nodes are represented as circles with labels indicating their role (e.g., entry, function call, exit).
- Edges show control flow without any conditions since it's a linear flow.
- Data flow is noted in the xlabel of each node.

I should number the nodes sequentially and ensure that the graph starts at the entry point and ends at the exit with a double circle.

Let me outline the nodes:

1. **Entry Node (Node 1)**: Represents the start, where variables are prepared for the function call.
2. **Function Call (Node 2)**: The actual encryption is performed here.
3. **Exit Node (Node 3)**: After the call, the function returns.

Edges will connect these nodes in order without any branches.

For data flow:

- Node 1 has definitions (def) for ctx, outbuf, and inbuf as they are parameters passed into the function.
- Node 2 uses (use) these variables when calling tripledes_ecb_encrypt. There's a C-use here because it's used computationally in the call.

Putting this all together, I'll create nodes with appropriate labels and connect them in sequence.

I should also ensure that the graph is directed from top to bottom using rankdir=TB.

So, the final DOT code will have three nodes connected linearly. Node 1 starts, node 2 does the encryption, and node 3 ends the function.
