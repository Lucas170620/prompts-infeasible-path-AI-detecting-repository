Okay, I need to generate a precise Hybrid Control and Data Flow Graph (CDFG) in Graphviz DOT format for the selftest function provided. Let me start by understanding what the code does.

Looking at the code, the selftest() function runs several checks: it tests Triple-DES encryption and decryption using specific test cases, checks weak keys, and performs other validations. If any test fails, it returns an error message; otherwise, it returns 0.

First, I'll identify all basic blocks in the selftest function. Each block is a sequence of instructions without any jumps or jumps to it.

1. The first part initializes 'error' as a static char array.
2. It declares variables 'result', 'i', and 'error'.
3. It loops through each test case, calling tripledes_ecb_encrypt and checking for encryption failure.
4. If encryption passes, it decrypts and checks again.
5. If any check fails, it returns an error string.
6. After all tests pass, it proceeds to the weak key detection loop.
7. This loop checks each weak key in a predefined list; if any are not detected as weak, it returns an error.
8. Finally, if all checks pass, it returns 0.

Next, I'll map definitions (def) and uses (c-use/p-use). For example:

- Variable 'i' is defined in the loop initialization and used in comparisons.
- 'result' is defined when assigned from the encryption/decryption functions.
- 'error' is a static variable but gets modified when an error occurs.

Now, I'll structure each node in the CDFG. Each node represents a basic block with control flow decisions and data usage.

I need to represent:

- Nodes for each major instruction or group of instructions.
- Control flows: true/false branches from conditionals (if statements).
- Data flow: showing where variables are used or defined.

The function selftest() has several key points:

1. The initial loop over testdata.
2. Encryption check within the loop.
3. Decryption check within the loop.
4. Weak key checks after the loop.

Each of these will be separate nodes in the CDFG.

I'll start numbering the nodes sequentially, starting from 1.

Let's break down each part:

Node 1: The beginning where 'i' is declared and initialized, and the loop starts.
- This node has a definition for 'i'.
- It uses 'testdata' and calculates the size.

Node 2: Inside the loop, before encryption.
- Prepares to call tripledes_ecb_encrypt.
- Uses variables des3, testdata[i].plain, result.

Node 3: The condition after encryption (memcmp).
- Checks if encryption was successful.
- If true, proceeds; else, returns error.

Node 4: Returns an error message for encryption failure.
- This node has a definition of the error string and returns control.

Node 5: After encryption check passes, moves to decryption.
- Uses des3 again and testdata[i].cipher.

Node 6: The condition after decryption (memcmp).
- Checks if decryption was successful.
- If true, continues; else, returns another error message.

Node 7: Returns an error message for decryption failure.

Node 8: Loop continues to next iteration or exits when i increments beyond the array size.

After the loop:

Node 9: Starts checking weak keys.
- Uses the weak_keys array and loops through each key.

Node 10: Inside the weak key loop, checks if a key is weak.
- If not, returns an error.

Node 11: After all weak keys are checked successfully.

Node 12: Returns 0 as all tests passed.

Now, I'll connect these nodes with edges representing control flow. Each condition (if statement) will have two outgoing edges: one for true and another for false, labeled with their respective conditions.

For example:

- Node 3 has an edge to Node 4 if the encryption check fails.
- It also has an edge to Node 5 if it passes.
- Similarly, Node 6 has edges to Node 7 (if decryption fails) or continues to the next iteration.

I need to ensure that loops are represented correctly. The for loop in the test cases and the for loop checking weak keys will each have their own nodes and control flows.

Finally, I'll represent the end of the function with a doublecircle node as specified.

Now, putting it all together into the Graphviz DOT format, making sure to label each node with its definitions and uses, and correctly link them with directed edges showing both control flow and data dependencies.
