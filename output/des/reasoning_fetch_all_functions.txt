Okay, I need to analyze the given code and extract all user-defined functions. Let me start by reading through the code carefully.

Looking at the beginning, there's a comment block with some code snippets, but no function definitions there. Then I see the function `is_weak_key` is called, but its definition isn't shown here. Next, in the `selftest()` function, several functions are used like `fprintf`, which are built-in, so they shouldn't be included.

Moving further down, I spot `do_tripledes_setkey`, `do_tripledes_encrypt`, and `do_tripledes_decrypt` as user-defined functions. These are definitely to be listed.

Then there's the function `des_get_info`, which is also defined by the user. It has several parameters but that's okay since we just need the names.

Wait, earlier in the code, I think I missed some functions. Let me go back. Oh yes, inside the `selftest()` function, it calls `is_weak_key` and others, but those are helper functions probably defined elsewhere.

So compiling all the user-defined functions from the provided code:

1. is_weak_key (even though its definition isn't shown here, it's called in do_tripledes_setkey)
2. selftest
3. do_tripledes_setkey
4. do_tripledes_encrypt
5. do_tripledes_decrypt
6. des_get_info

Wait, I think `selftest` is a function because it's called with `s = selftest();`. So yes, that should be included.

Let me make sure I didn't miss any. Looking through the code again:

- The functions declared as static are do_tripledes_setkey, do_tripledes_encrypt, and do_tripledes_decrypt.
- des_get_info is another function.
- selftest is called but its definition isn't shown here, but since it's used, it must be defined elsewhere in the user's code.

So I'll list all these functions as per the rules.
