Alright, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze the given code for infeasible paths using the CDFG provided. Let me go through each function one by one.

Starting with `des_get_info`, looking at the CDFG description, there are a few key points. The function begins by checking if `did_selftest` is false. If it's false, it calls `selftest()`. Depending on the result of this test, different paths are taken. If `selftest()` fails, the function returns `NULL`, which stops execution immediately. So any path that tries to execute code after a failed selftest is impossible because the function exits right away.

Next, if `did_selftest` was true (meaning the initial check passed), the function proceeds to check if the algorithm is 3DES. If it's not, again, it returns `NULL`. But if it is 3DES, it sets up some parameters and returns "3DES". 

Looking at this flow, I can see that once `selftest()` fails, there's no way for the function to continue further. So any path that would execute code after a failed selftest is inviable because the function exits early.

Moving on to `do_tripledes_encrypt` and `do_tripledes_decrypt`, these functions are quite straightforward. Each just calls another function without any conditionals or loops. That means there's only one possible execution path for each, so no infeasible paths here—they’re linear with no branches.

For `do_tripledes_setkey`, the CDFG isn't provided, but based on its name and typical naming conventions, it likely sets up the encryption key. Without seeing the actual code, I can’t identify specific infeasible paths, but generally, functions like this tend to have minimal control flow unless there are error checks or different algorithms involved.

Considering all these points, the only function with potential infeasible paths is `des_get_info` due to the early exits after a failed selftest. All other functions have straightforward execution flows without any branches or conditions that could lead to impossible paths.
