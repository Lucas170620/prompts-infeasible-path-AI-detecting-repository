To identify any infeasible paths within the provided code, we analyze each possible execution flow based on logical conditions. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Initial Check (`did_selftest` is false):**
   - Runs `selftest()`.
     - If failure: Function returns `NULL`, terminating further execution.
     - If success: Sets `did_selftest = 1` and proceeds to check the algorithm.

2. **Algorithm Check:**
   - Only if `algo == 3DES`, setup parameters and return "3DES".
   - Else, function returns `NULL`.

**Infeasible Paths Identified:**

- Any path attempting to execute code after a failed `selftest()` is impossible because the function exits immediately upon error.

These are the only infeasible scenarios as any execution beyond an error state is logically impossible.
