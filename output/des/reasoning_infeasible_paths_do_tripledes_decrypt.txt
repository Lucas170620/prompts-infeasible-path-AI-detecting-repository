Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze the given code and its CDFG for infeasible paths. Let me start by understanding what's provided.

The function in question is `do_tripledes_decrypt`, which seems to be part of a 3DES encryption/decryption implementation. The code provided defines this function as follows:

```c
static void
do_tripledes_decrypt( struct _tripledes_ctx *ctx, byte *outbuf, byte *inbuf )
{
    tripledes_ecb_decrypt ( ctx, inbuf, outbuf );
}
```

And the CDFG is a Graphviz DOT file describing the control and data flow of this function. The CDFG has three nodes:

1. Node 1: Represents the input with parameters `ctx`, `inbuf`.
2. Node 2: Shows the call to `triplesec_ecb_decrypt` with definitions and uses of variables.
3. Node 3: The output, a double circle node.

The edges are straightforward: Input (Node 1) -> Function Call (Node 2) -> Output (Node 3).

Now, I need to perform the steps outlined:

**Passo 1: Mapeamento Código-CDFG**

Looking at the code and CDFG:

- Node 1 corresponds to the function's declaration line.
- Node 2 is the single statement inside the function where `triplesec_ecb_decrypt` is called.
- Node 3 represents the return, but in this case, since it's a void function returning nothing, it might just be an exit point.

Each node in the CDFG seems to map directly to lines of code. The edges represent the flow: from the function parameters (Node 1) leading into the function call (Node 2), and then exiting after that call (Node 3).

**Passo 2: Identificação de Caminhos Potenciais**

In this case, since there's only one statement inside the function, the control flow is straightforward. The path goes from Node 1 to Node 2 to Node 3. There are no branches or conditionals here, so there's only one possible path.

**Passo 3: Classificação de Inviabilidade**

I need to check if this single path is feasible. Since there are no conditions, the function always executes the call to `triplesec_ecb_decrypt`. 

But wait, I should look for any potential issues:

- Are all variables used in Node 2 properly initialized? Let's see: `ctx` and `inbuf` are parameters passed into the function. Assuming that these are correctly handled by whoever calls this function, there shouldn't be any uninitialized data here.

However, looking at the function signature of `triplesec_ecb_decrypt`, I should ensure that it expects valid pointers. If `outbuf` or `inbuf` are null, that could cause issues, but that's more about input validation rather than control flow infeasibility.

**Passo 4: Análise de Viabilidade por Critério**

For the single path:

1. **Dados**: Both `ctx`, `outbuf`, and `inbuf` should be properly initialized before this function is called. If they are not, that's a problem but not necessarily an infeasible path per se—it would lead to undefined behavior or errors, but the control flow itself remains feasible.

2. **Lógica**: There are no conditions here; it's a straightforward call. So, no logical contradictions.

3. **Contexto**: No invariant constraints that would prevent this single statement from executing.

4. **Loop**: No loops involved, so nothing to check there.

**Passo 5: Consolidação**

Since the function has only one possible path and there are no conditions or branches leading to infeasibility, I don't see any infeasible paths here. The function's structure doesn't allow for multiple execution paths beyond the single call it makes.
