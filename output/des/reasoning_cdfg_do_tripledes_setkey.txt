Okay, I need to create a CDFG (Control and Data Flow Graph) in Graphviz DOT format for the function do_tripledes_setkey provided. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I'll look at the function do_tripledes_setkey:

static int
do_tripledes_setkey ( struct _tripledes_ctx *ctx, byte *key, unsigned keylen )
{
    if( selftest_failed )
	return G10ERR_SELFTEST_FAILED;
    if( keylen != 24 )
	return G10ERR_WRONG_KEYLEN;

    tripledes_set3keys ( ctx, key, key+8, key+16);

    if( is_weak_key( key ) || is_weak_key( key+8 ) || is_weak_key( key+16 ) )
	return G10ERR_WEAK_KEY;

    return 0;
}

Let me break it down into basic blocks.

The function starts with two conditional checks. The first check returns an error if selftest_failed is true. Then, the second check verifies if keylen is 24; if not, returns an error. If both conditions pass, it proceeds to call tripledes_set3keys and then another check for weak keys. Finally, it returns 0.

Now, I need to represent each statement as a node in the graph. Let's number them sequentially:

1. Check selftest_failed
2. Check keylen !=24
3. Call tripledes_set3keys
4. Check if any key is weak
5. Return 0

Each node will have labels indicating their operation and data flow.

For each node, I need to note the definitions (def) and uses (c-use/p-use). 

- Node 1: Uses selftest_failed.
- Node 2: Uses keylen.
- Node 3: Uses ctx and key.
- Node 4: Uses key, key+8, key+16.
- Node 5: No data usage.

Now, connect the nodes with edges. The control flow is sequential unless there are conditionals. In this case, each check is a conditional that returns if not met, so it's like an AND of conditions. So after node 1 (if passed), we proceed to node 2. If both pass, then to node3, then node4. After passing all, node5.

So the edges are:

1 -> 2 (since if selftest failed, returns; else proceeds)
2 -> 3
3 ->4
4->5

Wait, but in code, each check is a separate condition with return statements. So after each check that fails, it returns immediately. So the flow is like:

Start at node1: if true (selftest failed), return G10ERR_SELFTEST_FAILED.

If node1 passes, go to node2: check keylen !=24, and if true, return G10ERR_WRONG_KEYLEN.

Else proceed to node3: call function.

After node3, check node4: if any weak keys, return G10ERR_WEAK_KEY.

If all pass, proceed to node5: return 0.

So the graph will have edges from each node to their respective returns or next step.

Wait, but in control flow graphs, nodes represent basic blocks. So after node1, if it's a conditional that returns, then the next node is only taken if the condition is false.

So I think I need to model this correctly with conditional flows.

Alternatively, perhaps each check is an edge with conditions leading to either returning or proceeding.

Wait, let me try to outline:

- Node 1: if (selftest_failed) return error. So it's a decision node that returns on true, else proceeds.

So the graph would have:

Node1 has two edges: one for when selftest_failed is true (return), and another when false (proceed).

Similarly, Node2 checks keylen !=24: if true, return; else proceed.

Same with Node4: if any weak keys, return; else proceed to node5.

So the nodes are:

1. Check selftest_failed
   - If true: return error.
   - Else: go to 2

2. Check keylen ==24?
   - If false (keylen !=24): return error.
   - Else: go to3

3. Call tripledes_set3keys
   - Proceed to4 regardless.

4. Check if any keys are weak
   - If true: return G10ERR_WEAK_KEY
   - Else: proceed to5

5. Return 0 (terminal node)

So the nodes and edges would be:

- Node1 is a diamond (decision) with two edges: one for returning, another leading to node2.

Wait, but each of these functions returns immediately if a condition fails. So perhaps the basic blocks are as follows:

BB1: selftest check
   if true -> return error
   else proceed to BB2

BB2: keylen check
   if true -> return error
   else proceed to BB3

BB3: call tripledes_set3keys

BB4: weak key check
   if true -> return error
   else proceed to BB5

BB5: return 0

So the graph would have:

- Node1 (BB1) with a condition leading either to returning or proceeding.

But in the context of CDFG, each conditional is represented as a node. So I'll model this with edges representing the conditions.

Now, let's assign each basic block a number and describe their def/use.

Node1:
   Uses: selftest_failed
   If true (def): return error.
   Else: proceed to Node2

Wait, but perhaps in terms of data flow:

Each node represents a set of instructions. For the function, I need to model the control flow as well as data usages and definitions.

So for each node:

1:
- Check if selftest_failed is true
  - If yes: return error.
  - Else: proceed

2:
- Check keylen !=24
  - If yes: return error
  - Else: proceed

3:
- Call tripledes_set3keys (uses ctx and key)
- Proceed to Node4.

4:
- Check if any key is weak
  - If yes: return error
  - Else: proceed

5:
- Return 0

So now, let me model this in the CDFG:

Nodes are numbered as follows:

1. selftest check (decision node)
2. keylen check (decision node)
3. set3keys call (process node)
4. weak key check (decision node)
5. return 0 (terminal)

Each decision node has two edges: one for true condition and another for false, leading to the next appropriate node.

So in the DOT code:

digraph do_tripledes_setkey {
    rankdir=TB;
    
    // Node definitions
    1 [label="Check selftest_failed" shape=diamond xlabel="selftest_failed"];
    2 [label="Check keylen ==24" shape=diamond xlabel="keylen !=24"];
    3 [label="Call tripledes_set3keys(ctx, key, key+8, key+16)" shape=box];
    4 [label="Check is_weak_key for all keys" shape=diamond xlabel="is_weak_key"];
    5 [label="Return 0" shape=doublecircle];

    // Edges
    1 -> 2 [label="False\n(selftest not failed)"];
    1 -> 5 [label="True\n(selftest_failed)"];  // Wait, no: if selftest Failed, return error. So from node1, on true, returns an error (which is a terminal). Hmm, perhaps I should represent the error returns as part of the nodes.

Wait, but in the code, each condition leads to a return. So after Node1:

If selftest_failed is true, function returns G10ERR_SELFTEST_FAILED (so it's a sink node).

Similarly, if keylen !=24, returns another error.

Same for weak keys: returns an error if any are found.

Only if all pass does it reach the final return 0.

So perhaps each decision node has two edges:

- On condition met: returns an error (terminal)
- Else: proceed to next node

Thus, in the graph:

Node1:
   If selftest_failed is true: edge to a terminal node with that error.
   Else: edge to Node2.

But wait, this would require each return to be a separate sink. Alternatively, perhaps it's better to have each decision node lead either to a return (as an exit) or proceed.

So let me structure the graph as follows:

Nodes:

1: selftest check
   Edges:
      - if true: -> Return SelfTestError (terminal)
      - else: -> Node2

Node2: keylen check
   Edges:
      - if true: -> Return KeyLenError (terminal)
      - else: -> Node3

Node3: set keys
   Edge: always -> Node4

Node4: weak key check
   Edges:
      - if true: -> Return WeakKeyError (terminal)
      - else: -> Node5

Node5: return 0 (terminal)

So the graph will have these nodes and edges.

Now, let's define each node in the DOT code:

1. Node1 is a decision node (diamond) with two outgoing edges: one for returning error on true, another leading to Node2.
2. Node2 similarly is a diamond with two edges: return error or proceed.
3. Node3 is a process box with an edge to Node4.
4. Node4 is a diamond with edges to return error or proceed to Node5.
5. Node5 is the end node (double circle).

Now, data usages:

- Node1 uses selftest_failed
- Node2 uses keylen
- Node3 uses ctx and key
- Node4 uses key, key+8, key+16

I'll include this information in the xlabel.

Putting it all together, here's the DOT code:
