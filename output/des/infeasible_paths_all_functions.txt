**Analysis of Infeasible Paths**

**Function: des_get_info**
- **Infeasible Path #1:** Nodes [1 â†’ 2 (False)]
  - **Reason:** After a failed `selftest()`, the function returns `NULL` and exits, making any subsequent code unreachable.

**Functions: do_tripledes_encrypt and do_tripledes_decrypt**
- **No Infeasible Paths Identified.**
  - These functions have linear execution paths with no conditional branches or loops.

**Function: do_tripledes_setkey**
- **No Information Provided for Analysis.**
  - Typically straightforward, but without specific code, no infeasible paths can be identified.

**Summary of Findings**

- **Critical Infeasible Paths Identified:** Present only in `des_get_info` due to early exits after selftest failure.
- **Recommendations:**
  - Ensure that error handling in `des_get_info` is comprehensive to avoid partial execution.
  - Consider refactoring complex functions for clarity and ease of testing.

**Impact on Test Coverage:**

- Identifying these paths helps in crafting more effective test cases, ensuring full coverage and reducing potential bugs from unreachable code.
