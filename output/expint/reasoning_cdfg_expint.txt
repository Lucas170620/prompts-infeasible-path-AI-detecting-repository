Okay, I need to create a precise CDFG (Control and Data Flow Graph) in Graphviz DOT format for the given expint function. Let me start by understanding the code step by step.

First, looking at the expint function, it's written in C. It takes two arguments: an integer n and a long int x. The function has several variables like i, ii, nm1, a, b, c, etc. 

The function starts by setting nm1 to n-1. Then there's an if statement checking if x is greater than 1. If true, it executes one block; otherwise, another.

In the first block (x>1), it initializes variables b, c, d, and h. There's a loop that runs up to 100 iterations. Inside the loop, variables are updated, and there's a condition checking if del is less than 10000. If so, it calculates ans and returns.

In the else block (x<=1), it sets ans based on nm1. Then another loop runs up to 100. Inside this loop, fact is calculated, and del depends on whether i equals nm1 or not. There's a nested loop inside when i == nm1, which computes psi.

Now, I need to break down the code into basic blocks and map data flow.

Starting with Node 1: The initial line where nm1 = n-1. This is the first node.

Next, the if condition (x>1). So Node 2 represents this decision point.

If x>1 is true (taken), we enter the block initializing b, c, d, h. That's Node 3.

Then there's a loop starting from i=1 to 100. Each iteration has several calculations. Let me split this into nodes for each significant operation inside the loop.

So inside the first loop:
- Calculate a = -i*(nm1+i) → Node 4
- Update b +=2 → Node5
- Compute d=10*(a*d +b) → Node6
- c = b + a/c → Node7
- del = c*d → Node8
- h *= del → Node9
- Check if del <10000 → Node10

If del <10000 is true, compute ans and return. So that's Node11.

Else, continue the loop until i reaches 100.

After the loop, there might be an error condition, but in the given code, it just returns after the loop.

Now for the else block (x<=1):

Node2 leads to this path if x<=1. So after the if-else decision, we have Node3a where ans is set based on nm1.

Then another loop starting from i=1 to 100. Inside:
- fact *= -x/i → Node4a
- Check if i != nm1: compute del = -fact/(i-nm1) → Node5a
- Else, compute psi by summing ii and nm1 in a nested loop (Nodes6a-7a)
- Then del is set based on fact and psi → Node8a

After computing del, add it to ans → Node9a.

There's also an inner loop when i == nm1. So for each iteration of the outer loop, if i equals nm1, we enter this sub-block (Nodes6a and 7a).

Putting all these nodes together, I need to connect them with edges representing control flow and data dependencies.

Each node will have a label indicating its operation and any definitions or uses. For example, Node1 has def: nm1, uses n. Nodes inside loops will track variables like i, x, etc.

I also need to ensure that each node's shape reflects its type: boxes for processing steps, diamonds for decisions, and double circles for exits.

Finally, I'll number all nodes sequentially and create the DOT code with appropriate edges and labels.
