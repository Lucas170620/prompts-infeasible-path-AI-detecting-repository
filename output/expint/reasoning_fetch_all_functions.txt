Okay, so I'm looking at this problem where I need to extract all the user-defined functions from a given C code. The user has provided some code and wants me to list just the function names, ignoring any built-in or library functions. They also mentioned to include even the main function.

First, I'll scan through the code to find any function definitions. In C, functions are defined with the syntax "return_type function_name(parameters) { ... }". So I'm looking for lines that start with a return type, followed by the function name.

Looking at the provided code, the first function I see is `expint`. It's declared as `long int expint(int n, long int x)`, so its name is `expint`.

Then there's another function named `foo` defined as `long int foo(long int x)`.

After that, in the main section, there's a call to `expint(50,1);`. But wait, I need to check if `main` is also a user-defined function. Yes, it is. The code has `void main(void) { ... }`, so that's another function named `main`.

I should make sure I don't miss any other functions. Scanning through, those are the only three: expint, foo, and main.

So, compiling these names in order as they appear in the code, I have:

1. expint
2. foo
3. main

That's all. There are no other functions defined by the user in this snippet.
