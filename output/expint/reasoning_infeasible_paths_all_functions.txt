Okay, so I'm trying to figure out how to analyze the given code for infeasible paths. The main function here is `expint`, and there's also a `foo` function. From what I understand, an infeasible path is a path through the code that cannot be executed under any circumstances due to logical constraints or impossible conditions.

Looking at the provided CDFG for `expint`, it seems like the function has two main branches: one where `x > 1` and another where `x <= 1`. The part that caught my attention is the else block when `x <= 1`. Inside this else block, there's a loop that runs from `i = 1` to `100`, and within this loop, there's an if-else condition checking whether `i != nm1`.

Now, `nm1` is calculated as `n - 1`. So, if `n > 101`, then `nm1` would be greater than `100`. The loop only goes up to `i = 100`, which means that for any `n > 101`, the condition `i != nm1` will always be true. This makes the else clause inside the loop (where `i == nm1`) unreachable because `i` can never equal `nm1` in this scenario.

So, if someone passes an input where `n > 101` and `x <= 1`, the code inside that else clause will never execute. This is a prime example of a dynamically infeasible path because it's impossible for those conditions to be met during execution. 

I should also check other parts of the code, but from what I can see, this seems like the main point where an infeasible path occurs. The `foo` function doesn't seem to have any such issues as it's straightforward arithmetic operations without conditional branches that could lead to impossible paths.

In summary, the key insight is recognizing that when `n > 101`, the loop in the else block won't reach the necessary index, making certain code unreachable.
