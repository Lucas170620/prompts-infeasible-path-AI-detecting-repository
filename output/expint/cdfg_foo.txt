To generate a precise Control and Data Flow Graph (CDFG) for the function `foo`, we break down each operation and represent data flow between them. Here's the structured CDFG in both the DOT notation and code mapping.

### CDFG Structure:
- **Nodes**:
  - Node 1: Compute `a = x * x`
  - Node 2: Compute `b = 8 * x`
  - Node 3: Compute `c = b << (4 - x)`
  - Node 4: Compute `result = a + c`

- **Edges**:
  - Node 1 → Node 4 (data flow for `a`)
  - Node 2 → Node 3 (data flow for `b`)
  - Node 3 → Node 4 (data flow for `c`)

### DOT Notation:
```dot
digraph CDFG {
    node1 [label="Compute a = x * x"];
    node2 [label="Compute b = 8 * x"];
    node3 [label="Compute c = b << (4 - x)"];
    node4 [label="Compute result = a + c"];
    
    node1 -> node4;
    node2 -> node3;
    node3 -> node4;
}
```

### Code Mapping:
```codemapping
Node 1: Compute a = x * x
Node 2: Compute b = 8 * x
Node 3: Compute c = b << (4 - x)
Node 4: Compute result = a + c; return result
```

This CDFG precisely captures the data flow and control flow of the `foo` function, showing how each operation contributes to the final result.
