The problem involves analyzing a piece of C code and identifying potential infeasible paths based on specific input constraints. After examining the code structure and control flow, we found an infeasible path scenario:

When `n > 101` and `x <= 1`, the loop inside the else block runs from `i = 1` to `100`. Since `n > 101` implies `nm1 = n - 1 > 100`, none of the iterations will reach `i = nm1`. Consequently, the code inside node 17 (the else clause) is never executed, making that path infeasible.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Understand the Control Flow:**
   - The code splits into two main paths based on whether `x > 1` or `x <= 1`.
   - In the `x <= 1` case, a loop runs from `i = 1` to `100`, checking if `i == nm1`.

2. **Analyze Loop Execution:**
   - If `n > 101`, then `nm1 > 100`.
   - Since the loop only goes up to `i = 100`, `i` can never equal `nm1` within this range.

3. **Identify Unreachable Code:**
   - The else clause (node 17) inside the loop is unreachable when `n > 101` because `i` never equals `nm1`.
   - This makes any code relying on node 17 being executed under these conditions an infeasible path.

4. **Conclusion on Infeasibility:**
   - Paths leading to node 17 are dynamically infeasible when `x <= 1` and `n > 101` because the loop cannot reach `i = nm1`.

**Answer:**

The identified infeasible path occurs under the conditions where `n > 101` and `x <= 1`. In such cases, the code within node 17 is unreachable. Therefore, any attempt to execute this part of the code results in an infeasible path.

$\boxed{\text{When } n > 101 \text{ and } x \leq 1, \text{ the path involving node 17 is infeasible.}}$
