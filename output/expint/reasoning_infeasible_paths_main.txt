Okay, I'm trying to figure out how to analyze the given code and its CDFG to identify infeasible paths. Let me start by understanding what's provided.

The main function calls expint(50,1). The expint function has two main branches: one when x > 1 and another when x <= 1. Since x is 1 in this case, it will take the else branch.

Looking at the code for expint when x <=1:

- It initializes ans based on whether nm1 (n-1) is zero or not. Here, n=50, so nm1=49.
- Then it loops up to MAXIT (100 times), but for each iteration, if i != nm1, del is calculated as -fact/(i-nm1). However, when i equals nm1 (which is 49 in this case), it computes psi and del differently.

In the else block:
- For the given n=50, nm1=49, so ans = ... : 2.
- fact starts at 1.
- Loop for i from 1 to 100:
   - When i != 49: del is calculated as -fact/(i-49).
   - When i ==49: compute psi by summing ii + nm1 (which is 49) from 1 to 49. Then del = psi + fact*foo(x). Foo(x) returns x² + ((8x) << 4 -x), but since x=1, it's 1 + (8<<4 -1)= 1 + (256-1)= 256.

So in the i=49 iteration:
   fact is the product of -x/i for each step up to i=49. But wait, let me check if x is 1 and n=50.

Wait, no: when expint(50,1) is called, x=1, so in the else block, x remains 1 throughout that part.

So for i from 1 to 100:

- At each step, fact *= -x/i. Since x is 1, it's -i! (since product of -1/2, -1/3 etc.)
Wait no: let me compute:

fact starts at 1.
For i=1: fact = 1 * (-1)/1 = -1
i=2: fact *= (-1)/2 => (-1)*( -0.5) = 0.5
i=3: fact *= (-1)/3 => 0.5*(-0.333..)= -0.166...
And so on, until i=49.

At i=49:
del is computed as fact * (psi + ...) where psi is sum of ii from 1 to 49 plus 49 each time? Wait:

No: psi = 0x00FF; which is 255. Then for ii from 1 to nm1=49, psi += ii + nm1. So psi starts at 255 and adds (ii+49) for each ii up to 49.

So for each ii in 1..49: psi increases by (ii +49). The total sum added is sum_{ii=1 to 49} (ii +49) = sum(ii) from 1-49 + 49*49. Sum of 1-49 is (49*50)/2 = 1225, and 49*49=2401, so total added is 3626. So psi becomes 255 + 3626 = 3881.

Then del = psi + fact * foo(1). Foo(1) is (1^2) + ((8*1)<<4 -1) = 1 + (8 <<4 is 256, minus 1 is 255. So 1+255=256.

So del = 3881 + fact * 256.

But what's the value of fact at i=49?

Let me compute step by step for each i up to 49:

fact starts as 1.
i=1: fact *= -1/1 → fact=-1
i=2: fact *= (-1)/2 → (-1)*(-0.5)=0.5
i=3: fact *= (-1)/3 → 0.5 * (-0.333..) ≈-0.166...
Continuing this, for i=49, fact would be a product of -1/2, -1/3,... up to -1/49.

Wait no: because for each step i from 1 to 49, fact is multiplied by (-x)/i. Since x is 1, it's (-1)* (1/i) at each step.

So after i=1: fact = -1
i=2: fact *= -0.5 → (-1)*(-0.5)=0.5
i=3: 0.5*(-1/3)= ~-0.1667
...
At i=49, the product is 1 * product from k=1 to 49 of (-1)/k.

Wait no: wait fact starts at 1, then multiplied by -x/i each time, where x is 1 and i runs from 1 to 49.

So after all steps up to i=49:

fact = product_{i=1 to 49} (-1/i) = [(-1)^49] * (1/(49!))).

Since 49 is odd, this is -1/(49!) ≈ a very small negative number.

So fact at i=49 is approximately -1/(49!), which is a tiny number, close to zero but negative.

Then del = psi + fact * foo(x) → 3881 + (-tiny)*256 → essentially 3881 minus a negligible amount.

But wait, in the code:

del = psi + fact*foo(x); since fact is very small and multiplied by 256 (a positive number), but since fact is negative, it's subtracting a tiny value from 3881. So del would be approximately 3881.

Then ans += del; adding this to the previous sum.

But after that loop, the function returns ans.

Now, looking at the CDFG provided:

The main function only calls expint(50,1), which takes the else branch in expint. The CDFG's nodes correspond to code sections.

In the provided CDFG, I can see that it starts with <main>, then likely branches based on the condition x > 1 or not.

But since x is 1, we're taking the else path. Now, let me think about potential infeasible paths.

Looking at the loop in expint's else branch:

Loop runs for i from 1 to 100. For each iteration, it checks if i != nm1 (49). If so, computes del as -fact/(i-49). But when i=49, it does something else.

Now, considering the code structure, let's see:

Is there any condition that could make a certain path impossible?

For example, in the loop, after computing del, we add to ans. But what if during some iterations, del becomes undefined or impossible? Let me check.

Wait, when i=49, we compute psi and then use it. But does this lead to any contradictions elsewhere?

Alternatively, perhaps there's a division by zero somewhere, but in the else block, when x <=1, all denominators would be i != nm1 for del computation, except when i=nm1.

Wait, no: because when i approaches nm1 (49), for other iterations, it's i-49, which could be 0? Wait no, because in the else block, we have:

if (i != nm1) {
    del = -fact/(i - nm1);
} else {
    // compute psi and del
}

Wait no, wait: looking back at the code.

In the expint function's else block, during each loop iteration, it checks if i is not equal to nm1. If so, del is set as -fact/(i-nm1). But when x=1, n=50, nm1=49, so for all i except 49, this would be fine because i-nm1 won't be zero.

But wait, for example, when i=50: then i-nm1 is 1, which is okay. So no division by zero in that case.

Wait, perhaps the issue arises elsewhere. Let me think about variable initializations.

Looking at the code:

In the else branch, ans is initialized as (n-1 !=0) ? ... : 0; since n=50, nm1=49 !=0 → ans =2.

Then fact starts at 1. So variables are properly initialized.

Another point to consider: in the loop, when i=49, we have a complex computation for del. But this doesn't cause any issues as far as I can see.

So where could an infeasible path be?

Wait, perhaps considering that after the loop, ans is returned. But since all paths lead to ans being updated and then returned, there's no way to skip returning a value. So every execution path returns ans.

But maybe some edge cases cause issues, but with x=1 and n=50, I don't see any division by zero or uninitialized variables.

Wait, perhaps the function calls foo(x), which for x=1 is fine, as shown earlier.

So maybe there are no infeasible paths here. Because the code correctly handles all possible i's, and since it's given specific inputs (x=1, n=50), there's no path that leads to a contradiction.

Thus, after analyzing, I think there are no infeasible paths.
