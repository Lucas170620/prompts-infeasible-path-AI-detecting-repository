Okay, so I have to analyze this expint function and its CDFG to find any infeasible paths. Hmm, let me start by understanding the code and the graph.

Looking at the expint function, it's a long function with two main branches based on whether x is greater than 1 or not. If x > 1, it does one set of calculations; otherwise, it does something else.

The CDFG provided shows nodes labeled from 1 to 19, each corresponding to specific code sections. Let me map them out.

Node 1: nm1 = n-1;
Node 2: if (x > 1)
Node 3: the block where b=x+n; c=2e6; etc.
Node 4: a = -i*(nm1+i);
And so on until node 19, which is ans += del.

Now, to find infeasible paths, I need to check all possible paths through this CDFG and see if any lead to logical contradictions or impossible data situations.

Starting with the main condition at Node 2: x > 1. So, two branches: True (Node 3) and False (Node 13).

First path: Node 2 -> Node 3.

In the True branch:
Nodes 4-9 define variables a, b, d, c, del, h.
Then, in node 10: if del < 10000, then return ans at node 12. Otherwise, it continues looping.

But wait, looking at how del is computed: del = c*d; which are based on previous calculations involving a and b. Since a can be negative (because i starts from 1 to 100), and d is being updated each loop, could del ever become less than 10000? Or maybe not? Hmm.

But that's more about whether the loop exits quickly, but in terms of logical feasibility, it's more about variable values rather than program logic.

Looking for data dependencies: All variables here seem to be properly initialized. So no immediate inviability here.

Now, the else branch from Node 2 is taken when x <=1. That goes to Node 13.

Node 13 sets ans based on nm1, then initializes fact=1.

Then, it enters a loop at Node 14: for i from 1 to 100.

Inside the loop:
Node 15 updates fact *= -x/i;
Then, if i != nm1 (node 16), del is set as -fact/(i-nm1). Else (node 17) it computes psi and then sets del.

Wait a second. Let's think about node 17: when i == nm1, which is n-1. Suppose n=50, so nm1=49. So in the loop when i reaches 49, this else block runs.

In that case, it computes psi as 0x00FF plus a sum of ii from 1 to nm1 (which is 49). Then, del is fact * foo(x) + something? Wait no: del = psi + fact*foo(x); but looking back at the code:

Wait in node 17's code description, it says "psi += ii + nm1" for each ii from 1 to nm1. So for each iteration of ii inside that loop, it adds both ii and nm1 (which is a constant). Wait no, no: looking at the code provided earlier:

The code for node 17 is: psi += ii + nm1; but wait, in reality, the code says "psi += ii + nm1" inside the loop over ii. So for each ii from 1 to nm1 (assuming nm1=49), it adds both ii and nm1.

Wait that's an issue because if ii runs up to nm1, then when ii is equal to nm1, you're adding nm1 twice. But more importantly, does this cause any data inconsistency?

Not necessarily. Unless this causes some kind of overflow or unexpected value, but in terms of logical paths, it's about whether the conditions lead to impossible situations.

Now, looking for possible inviability: Suppose during the else branch (x <=1), let's say x is 0. Then fact *= -x/i would be 0 after i=1. So fact becomes zero and remains zero.

Then, in node 15: when i increases beyond 1, fact is multiplied by zero each time, so it stays zero.

Now, looking at the condition in node 16: if i != nm1, which for n=50 would mean i ranges up to 49. So for most iterations, del = -fact/(i-nm1) → since fact is zero, del becomes zero.

But when i == nm1 (i=49), it goes into node 17 where psi is calculated as a sum of ii + nm1 for each ii from 1 to 49. Wait, that's a loop inside the main loop? So this would be nested loops, but in terms of CDFG, maybe represented as a separate branch.

But wait, I'm not sure if in the given CDFG, node 17 is reachable in all cases.

Wait no: node 13 (else) is only taken when x <=1. So within that block, variables ans and fact are initialized correctly.

Another point to consider: In the else branch, after setting ans, we enter the loop at node 14, which runs for i=1 to 100. Inside this loop, at node 15, fact is updated, then at node 16, it checks if i != nm1.

So for each i from 1 to 100:

- When i < nm1 or i > nm1: take the true branch (node 16) and set del as -fact/(i-nm1).
- When i == nm1: take the false branch, compute psi and then set del = fact * (-log(x) + psi).

But let's think about whether this is possible. For example, if i ever exceeds 100? No, because it's a for loop up to 100.

Now, what if nm1 > 100? That would mean n-1 > 100 → n>101. But the loop only goes up to i=100. So in such cases, when i < n-1 or i >= n (since n could be up to something), but since i can't reach beyond 100, and nm1 is n-1, if n > 101, then nm1 would be greater than 100.

Wait, so in that case, for all i from 1 to 100, i <= 100 < nm1. So the condition i != nm1 would always be true (since nm1>100), because i can't reach up to nm1. Therefore, in this scenario, the code inside node 17 (the else part of node 16) will never execute.

But how is that possible? Because if n is such that nm1 > 100, then for all i=1..100, i != nm1, so del is computed as -fact/(i-nm1). But since nm1>100 and i <=100, the denominator would be negative.

Wait but in this case, when n is greater than 101 (so nm1=101 or higher), for all i up to 100, i will be less than nm1. So the else branch (node 17) never runs because i never equals nm1.

But does that matter? Because in this case, when n is greater than 101 and x <=1, then during the loop for i=1 to 100, all del values are computed via node 16's true branch.

So what's wrong here? Well, if n is say 200, then nm1=199. So in the else block (x<=1), we have a loop up to i=100, which is less than 199. Therefore, node 17 will never be executed because i can't reach 199.

But is there any problem with that? Let's see: the code expects that for some i in the loop (up to 100), it might reach the else part, but if n is greater than 101, then the code would not execute node 17 at all. But in terms of program logic, this isn't an error because as long as n can be up to any value, but when x <=1 and n is such that nm1>100, the else part will never run.

Wait but looking back, the loop runs from i=1 to 100. So for any n where nm1 > 100 (n>101), in the else block, i can't reach nm1 because i only goes up to 100.

Therefore, when n is greater than 101 and x <=1, node 17 will never be executed. So in such cases, the code inside node 17 is unreachable.

But wait, according to the CDFG, node 17 is connected via an edge from node 16 (the else condition). So the path would be:

Node 2 → Node 13 → Node 14 → loop for each i, then for each i:

If i != nm1: Node 16's true branch.

Else: Node 16's false branch → Node 17 → compute psi and del.

But if n is such that nm1 >100, then no i in the loop will equal nm1. Therefore, node 17 can never be reached when x <=1 and n>101.

So this creates a situation where certain paths are impossible under specific conditions. For example, for any input with x<=1 and n>101, the code inside node 17 is unreachable (infeasible path).

Similarly, perhaps other nodes could be unreachable based on some invariants or constraints.

Another point: looking at the loop in the else branch. Since it runs up to i=100, what if n-1 (nm1) is less than or equal to 100? Then during the loop, for i = nm1, node 17's code would be executed.

But when n <=101, since then nm1<=100. Therefore, in this case, during the loop, at i=nm1, node 17's code is run.

So to sum up:

- When x>1: nodes 3-12 are reachable.
- When x<=1:
   - If n <=101 (so nm1 <=100): for i=nm1, the else branch at node 16 runs, so node 17 is executed.
   - If n >101: nm1>100, loop only goes to i=100, so node 17 is never reached.

So any path that includes reaching node 17 when n>101 and x<=1 is infeasible because it can't be executed. Hence, such a path would be dynamically infeasible under these conditions.

Looking at the CDFG: node 2 → node 13 → nodes inside loop (node 14) for i=1 to 100. For each i, if i==nm1, then node 17 is executed.

Therefore, the path from node 2 → 13 → 14 → ... → 16 (false) → 17 can only be taken when i == nm1 and i <=100, which implies n <=101. So for n>101, this path is impossible.

Another possible infeasible path: let's say someone passes x=2, which goes into node 3's block. Then, the loop runs for i from 1 to 100.

Wait, what if during that loop, del becomes less than 10000? Or not?

Well, whether the condition in node 10 is true depends on the computed del. But as per data flow, it's possible for del to be either greater or less than 10000 based on input values.

But that doesn't make a path infeasible; it just affects control flow. So unless there's a logical contradiction elsewhere, these paths are feasible.

Now, another angle: looking for uninitialized variables. All variables seem to be initialized before use:

- b is set in node 3.
- fact is initialized in node 13.
- ans is initialized in node 13.
- psi and del are used within their respective blocks where they're computed.

So no uninitialized variable issues here.

Another possible point: division by zero. For example, if i == nm1 in the else branch (node 16's true branch), then denominator is i - nm1 = 0. But wait, that would be when i=nm1, but for node 16's true branch, it's when i != nm1. So in the true branch, i-nm1 can't be zero because i is not equal to nm1.

Wait no: if i == nm1, then node 16's false branch is taken (node 17). Otherwise, for other i values, i - nm1 could potentially cause a division by zero? No, because the true branch would only be taken when i != nm1. So denominator is i-nm1, which can't be zero in that case.

Wait but wait: if i=nm1-1 or something, then denominator would be 1 or -1? Not sure. Wait no, the denominator could be any non-zero integer, as long as i isn't equal to nm1.

Therefore, division by zero is not a problem here because in node 16's true branch (i != nm1), the denominator can't be zero.

So I think the main infeasible path we found earlier is when n>101 and x<=1, making node 17 unreachable. Hence, any code that depends on node 17 being executed under these conditions would have an infeasible path.

Therefore, such a scenario represents a dynamically infeasible path, as the condition depends on input values (n >101 and x <=1).

So to recap: when x<=1 and n>101, the code inside node 17 is unreachable because i can't reach nm1 (since i only goes up to 100). Therefore, any path that includes nodes beyond node 16's false branch would be infeasible under these conditions.
