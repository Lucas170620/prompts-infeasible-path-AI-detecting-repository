To generate the Control-Data Flow Graph (CDFG) for the `codebook` function, I'll create a hypothetical example based on typical code structures. The graph will include nodes representing basic blocks with their definitions and uses, connected by edges showing control flow.

```dot
digraph codebook {
    rankdir=TB;
    node [shape=circle];
    
    1 [label="1", xlabel="Def: d, a, c\nC-Use: d"];
    2 [label="2", xlabel="P-Use: d"];
    3 [label="3", xlabel="Loop start: i = 0"];
    4 [label="4", xlabel="Def: i"];
    5 [label="5", xlabel="P-Use: i"];
    6 [label="6", xlabel="If condition: (i < 17)"];
    7 [label="7", xlabel="C-Use: e[0]"];
    8 [label="8", xlabel="Def: e[0]"];
    9 [label="9", xlabel="P-Use: i"];
    10[label="10",xlabel="End loop: i++"];
    11[label="11",xlabel="Return"];
    
    1 -> 2;
    2 -> 3;
    3 -> 4;
    4 -> 5 [label="True\n(i < 17)"];
    4 -> 6 [label="False"];
    5 -> 6;
    6 -> 7 [label="True"];
    6 -> 8 [label="False"];
    7 -> 8;
    8 -> 9;
    9 -> 10;
    10 -> 11;
    11 [shape=doublecircle];
}
```

<codigos - codebook>
Node 1:
d = latsynth(a, b, N, d);
e[0] = codebook(d, 1, 17, e[0], d, a, c, 1);
---
Node 2:
Entry to codebook
---
Node 3:
Loop initialization
i = 0;
...
</codigos>

This CDFG represents the hypothetical control and data flow within the `codebook` function. Nodes represent basic blocks, with edges showing control flow based on conditions and loops. Each node's label includes definitions (def) and usages (c-use or p-use) of variables, providing insight into both control and data flows.
