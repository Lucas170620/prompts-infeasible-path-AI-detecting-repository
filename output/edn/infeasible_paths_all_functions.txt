The analysis provided offers a comprehensive approach to identifying infeasible paths in code using Control Data Flow Graphs (CDFGs). Here's a structured summary:

### Key Functions and CDFGs:
1. **Function: `codebook`**
   - **Analysis:** Identified an infinite loop due to the condition `(i < 17)` always being true after `i = 0`.
   - **Conclusion:** The path is infeasible as it leads to an infinite loop with no exit.

2. **Function: `jpegdct`**
   - **Analysis:** No infeasible paths identified; the function follows a linear execution flow.
   - **Conclusion:** The straightforward logic without contradictions ensures all paths are feasible.

3. **Example Function: `calculate_grade` (hypothetical)**
   - **Condition Identified:** `(score > 100 && score < 50)` is logically impossible.
   - **Conclusion:** This condition indicates dead code, highlighting a clear infeasible path.

### Methodology:
- **Mapping CDFG to Code:** Each function's CDFG accurately reflects control and data flow.
- **Infeasibility Detection:**
  - Checked for logical contradictions.
  - Considered data dependencies and loop invariants.
  - Identified dead code and static vs. dynamic analysis considerations.

### Recommendations:
1. **Integration into Development Process:** Incorporate such static analysis to catch logical errors early.
2. **Testing Edge Cases:** Ensure thorough testing with various inputs to validate identified infeasible paths.
3. **Cross-Verification:** Confirm CDFGs align with actual code behavior to avoid incorrect conclusions.

This approach enhances software quality by proactively identifying and resolving potential issues through static analysis.
