Based on the analysis of the provided CDFG and the context of the function `fir_no_red_ld`, there are no identified infeasible paths. The function's control flow graph allows for two main execution paths, both of which terminate correctly without logical contradictions. 

1. **Path 1**: Enter the loop (node2 â†’ node3) until i >= N, then exit.
2. **Path 2**: Exit immediately if the loop condition is false.

Both paths are feasible as they eventually terminate and do not contain any inherent logical contradictions in their control flow. Data-related issues such as out-of-bounds accesses are beyond the scope of this analysis.

**Answer:** There are no infeasible paths identified in the provided CDFG for the function `fir_no_red_ld`.
