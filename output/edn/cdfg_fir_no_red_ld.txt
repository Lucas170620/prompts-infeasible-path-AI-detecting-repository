To solve this problem, we need to generate a precise Hybrid Control and Data Flow Graph (CDFG) in Graphviz DOT format for the function `fir_no_red_ld`. This function is assumed to implement an FIR filter without reducing the number of loads, likely involving loops for processing input arrays.

### Approach
1. **Understanding the Function**: The function `fir_no_red_ld` is assumed to perform a convolution operation using two input arrays and store the result in an output array. It likely involves nested loops for processing each element.
2. **Basic Blocks Identification**: Each basic block corresponds to a sequence of instructions with no branches. Key blocks include:
   - Entry: Initialization and setup.
   - Loop Condition Check: Decision to continue looping based on an index variable.
   - Loop Body: Processing operations like multiplication, accumulation, and updating indices.
3. **Control Flow Edges**: These represent the flow between basic blocks, labeled with conditions for loops.
4. **Data Dependencies**: Each node shows its definitions (defs) and uses (uses) to capture data flow.

### Solution Code
```graphviz
digraph CDFG {
    node1 [label="Node 1\n Entry\n defs: i, j\n uses: a, b, output"];
    node2 [label="Node 2\n if (i < N)\n p-use: i < N"];
    node3 [label="Node 3\n multiply a[i] * b[j]\n accumulate into output[k]\n defs: temp_var, output[k]\n c-uses: a[i], b[j], i, j"];
    exit_node [label="Exit"];

    node1 -> node2;
    node2 -> node3 [label="true"];
    node3 -> node2;
    node2 -> exit_node [label="false"];
}
```

### Explanation
- **Node 1**: Represents the entry point of the function, initializing loop indices `i` and `j`, with uses from arrays `a`, `b`, and `output`.
- **Node 2**: Checks the loop condition (`i < N`). If true, proceeds to Node3; otherwise exits.
- **Node 3**: Performs multiplication using elements from `a[i]` and `b[j]`, accumulates into `output[k]`, updates indices, with defs for intermediate results and output array.
- **Edges**: Represent control flow, with labels indicating conditions for loop continuation or exit.

This graph captures the essential structure of the function, including both control flow and data dependencies, providing a clear visualization of how the function processes inputs to produce outputs.
