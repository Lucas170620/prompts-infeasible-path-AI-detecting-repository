To analyze the code and its CDFG for infeasible paths, we consider the logical structure and possible conditions within each node.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Understanding the CDFG Structure:**
   - The graph starts at Node 1 (inputs) and processes through a loop.
   - Nodes 3 to 10 handle the loop's logic, including:
     - Starting the loop (Node 3).
     - Checking if `i < N` (Node 4).
     - Processing data from `a[i]` and `b[i]` (Nodes 5-7).
     - Evaluating a condition (Node 8), leading to either defining the result or exiting.
     - Ending the loop (Node 10) and outputting `d` (Node 11).

2. **Identifying Possible Paths:**
   - **Path A:** Enters loop, processes data, updates `d`, exits loop.
   - **Path B:** Enters loop, condition fails, skips result definition, exits loop.
   - **Path C:** Loop doesn't execute (N ≤ 0), exits immediately.

3. **Analyzing Feasibility:**
   - **Path A** and **B** depend on the loop's conditions and data processing.
   - If Node8's condition is logically impossible given previous operations, Path A becomes infeasible.
   - **Path C** is feasible when N ≤ 0 but depends on input validation.

4. **Conclusion:**
   - The primary potential infeasibility lies within Node8's condition. If it can't be met with the data from Nodes6 and 7, Path A is impossible.
   - Without specific details on `d`'s updates, we can infer that if Node8's condition is always false, Path A is infeasible.

### Final Answer:

There is one infeasible path due to an impossible condition check inside the loop.

**Infeasible Path:**

3 →4 (True) →5 →6 →7 →8 (True) →9 →10 →11

This path is infeasible if Node8's condition can never be satisfied with the given data from Nodes6 and 7.
