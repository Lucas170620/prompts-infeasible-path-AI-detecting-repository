Note: The above CDFG is a generic representation since the actual implementation of `latsynth` was not provided. Each node represents a basic block or control decision point, with dataflow and control dependencies mapped accordingly.

To generate a precise CDFG for the specific `latsynth` function, you would need to:

1. Identify all variables used in `latsynth`
2. Determine the sequence of operations
3. Map def/use relationships
4. Capture control flow conditions
5. Construct the graph with proper node shapes and edge labels

Without access to the full implementation of `latsynth`, this is a representative example based on typical patterns.
