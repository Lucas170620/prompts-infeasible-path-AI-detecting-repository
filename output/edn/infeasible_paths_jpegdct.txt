After carefully analyzing the code and its corresponding CDFG, there are no obvious logical contradictions or impossible control flow paths identified. Each step proceeds in a sequential manner without conditional branches that would make certain paths infeasible based on the given information.

**Answer:**

Based on the provided code and CDFG analysis, there are no infeasible paths identified. The function follows a linear execution flow with each operation proceeding sequentially without any logical contradictions or impossible control flow scenarios apparent from the given data.
