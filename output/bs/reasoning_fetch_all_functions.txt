Okay, so I need to analyze this code and extract all the user-defined functions or methods. The user mentioned ignoring built-in or library functions, which makes sense because those aren't defined by the user.

Looking at the code provided, let me start by scanning through it to find any function definitions. The code is in C, so I know that functions are declared with the syntax like `function_name() { ... }`.

First, I see the `main()` function at the bottom of the code. That's definitely a user-defined function because it's part of the main program execution.

Then, there's another function called `binary_search(x)`. This is also a user-defined function since it's declared with parentheses and a body following it. It doesn't look like a built-in function because binary search isn't a standard C library function; it's implemented here.

I should check if there are any other functions. The code has struct definitions, variables, and some conditional debug statements, but no additional function declarations. The `binary_search` function is the only one besides `main()`.

Wait, let me make sure I didn't miss anything. Sometimes in C, functions can be declared before they're used, but here, both are defined in the same file. So, it's clear that there are just two functions: `main` and `binary_search`.

I need to list all of them, each on a new line, without any bullets or numbers. Also, I should preserve their case as declared. So, the output will be:

main  
binary_search  

Yes, that covers both functions defined in the code.
