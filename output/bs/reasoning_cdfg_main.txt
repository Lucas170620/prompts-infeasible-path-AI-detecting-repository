Okay, so I need to generate a Control and Data Flow Graph (CDFG) in Graphviz DOT format for the provided C code's main function. Let me start by understanding what the code does.

The code defines a struct DATA with key and value, initializes an array of 15 such structs. The main function calls binary_search(8). The binary_search function performs a search on this data array.

First, I need to identify all the basic blocks in the binary_search function since that's where the main action is. Let me walk through the code step by step.

The function starts with initializing low=0, up=14, fvalue=-1. Then it enters a while loop (low <= up). Inside the loop, mid is calculated as (low + up) >> 1. It checks if data[mid].key equals x (which is 8 in this case). If found, sets up to low-1 and assigns fvalue, then continues. Else, it adjusts low or up based on whether data[mid].key is greater than x.

I need to break down each step into basic blocks. Each block represents a sequence of instructions with no jumps or breaks. So the loop body will have several blocks: calculating mid, checking equality, and adjusting low/up if not found.

Next, I'll map the definitions (def) and uses (c-use and p-use). For example:

- At the start, low is defined as 0, up as 14.
- In each iteration, mid is computed from low and up. So mid has c-uses of low and up, and defines mid.
- The condition data[mid].key == x uses mid (so p-use), data[mid].key, and x.

I should create nodes for each basic block, label them with the code snippet, and annotate their defs and uses. Then connect these nodes based on control flow: true/false branches from decisions, loop continuations, etc.

I'll number each node sequentially as I identify the blocks:

1. Initialization of variables.
2. While loop condition check (low <= up).
3. Calculate mid.
4. Check if data[mid].key == x.
5a. Found case: set up and return value.
5b. Not found: adjust up or low.

Each decision point will split into two edges: one for true, one for false. The loop continues until the condition fails, leading to exit.

I also need to represent the final node with a double circle since it's the end of the function. The nodes should be circles, and diamonds for decisions, but looking at the example, maybe all are circles. Hmm, the example used diamonds for if conditions, so perhaps I'll use diamond shapes for condition checks.

Wait, in the example, nodes were just circles. So I might represent control nodes as diamonds if they're decision points. Let me check the instructions: yes, diamonds for decisions, boxes for processing, double circles for end. But in the example, all were circles. Maybe it's more about operation type.

I think for this case, since all are process steps and decisions, I'll represent condition checks as diamonds (decision nodes) and regular blocks as boxes or other shapes as needed.

Finally, I need to write out the DOT code with nodes numbered, edges labeled with conditions, and proper annotations. Then create the mapping from code lines to node IDs.
