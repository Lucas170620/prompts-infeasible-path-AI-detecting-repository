Okay, so I need to analyze the given code and extract only the names of all user-defined functions or methods. I should ignore built-in or library functions. Let me look through the code carefully.

Starting from the top, I see there's a main function declared as void main(). That's definitely a user-defined function. Then, in the static functions section, there are fabs and log defined. So those are two more functions.

Looking further down, there's a sin function, which is also static. Inside it, they're using cos by calling sin(PI/2 - rad), but that's within the function's body, so I don't need to worry about that for now. Then, another static function called cos, which again is user-defined.

Moving on, in the main function, they call fft1 with some parameters, but fft1 is a separate function declared at the bottom of the code. So fft1 is another function to list.

Now, checking the functions inside fft1: there's a loop where it calls sin and cos, which are already counted. The rest of the functions like printf are built-in, so I ignore them.

So compiling all the user-defined functions:

- main
- fabs
- log
- sin
- cos
- fft1

I think that's all. Let me double-check to make sure I didn't miss any. Oh wait, there's also a function called chkerr being used in main(), but looking back, it's not defined anywhere else in the code provided. So maybe it's a built-in or assumed function, so I shouldn't include it.

Yes, that should be all.
