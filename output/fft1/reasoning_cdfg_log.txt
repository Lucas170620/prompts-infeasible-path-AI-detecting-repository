Okay, so I have to generate a Control and Data Flow Graph (CDFG) for the function `log` provided in the given code. The user has specified that they want it in Graphviz DOT format with specific styling. Let me go through this step by step.

First, I need to understand what the `log` function does. Looking at the code:

```c
static double log(double n)
{
  return(4.5);
}
```

It's a very simple function that takes a double and returns 4.5. There are no conditionals or loops here; it's just a single line returning a constant value.

Now, to create the CDFG for this function, I need to break down each part of the code into nodes representing basic blocks, data flow, and control flow. Since this function is straightforward, there should be minimal nodes.

Starting with the function entry, which is node 1. This node will represent the start point. Next, the return statement is a single operation, so that's node 2. Since the function ends after returning, node 3 will be the exit node, marked as doublecircle to indicate the end of the graph.

Now, mapping the nodes:

- Node 1: The function starts here. It doesn't have any control flow yet; it just proceeds to execute the next instruction.
- Node 2: This is where the return statement happens. There are no data definitions or uses beyond this point except for returning a value.
- Node 3: The exit node, indicating the end of the function.

For data flow, since the function doesn't use any variables (it directly returns a constant), there aren't many data usages. But I should note that 'n' is a parameter, so it's used in this function.

Looking at control flow, after node 1, the next step is node 2, and then immediately to node 3 as exit. There are no conditionals or loops, so the graph will be linear.

Now, structuring the DOT code:

- The graph should be a digraph named `log`.
- Nodes should have labels indicating their role (entry, return, exit) and any data flow information.
- Edges connect nodes in the order they execute, with no conditional branches since there are none here.

I also need to ensure that each node has appropriate labels. For instance, node 1 will show it's the entry point, node 2 shows the return operation, and node 3 is the exit with a doublecircle shape.

In terms of styling:

- Node 1: Entry, shape=box.
- Node 2: Process, shape=box.
- Node 3: Exit, shape=doublecircle.

Edges will connect them in sequence without any labels since there are no conditions or loops to branch.

Finally, the mapping part should list each node with their code snippets. Since it's a simple function, each node corresponds directly to parts of the code.

I think that covers all aspects. Now, I'll structure the DOT code and the mapping accordingly.
