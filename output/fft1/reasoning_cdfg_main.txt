Okay, I need to generate a hybrid Control and Data Flow Graph (CDFG) for the `main` function in the provided C code using Graphviz DOT notation. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this graph, including node types, edge labels, and data flow tracking.

First, I'll start by understanding the `main` function's structure. It initializes arrays, calls `fft1`, and then calls it again for inverse FFT. 

I'll break down the code into basic blocks. Each block will represent a single instruction or a group of instructions that are executed in sequence without any jumps or conditionals.

Next, I need to identify all variables and track their definitions and uses. For example, `n` is defined once and used multiple times. Arrays `ar` and `ai` are initialized and modified throughout the function.

I'll construct nodes for each basic block, noting down the definitions (def) and usages (C-use and P-use). C-use refers to computational uses where variables are operands in operations, while P-use is predicate uses in conditionals.

For control flow, I'll represent loops and conditional statements as decision nodes. The `for` loop in `main` will have a condition node with edges for true and false paths, but since it's always true, it might just point back to the body.

I need to ensure that each node has appropriate labels indicating data flow information. Nodes without definitions will only show uses, and vice versa.

Finally, I'll connect these nodes with directed edges, labeling them with conditions where applicable. The graph should be laid out vertically using `rankdir=TB`.

Now, I'll map each code segment to its corresponding node in the CDFG, ensuring that all control and data flows are accurately represented.
