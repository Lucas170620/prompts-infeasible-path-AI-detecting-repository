The function computes iter as log2(n), then checks if j equals n after doubling. If not, returns 1. For valid FFT inputs (n is power of two), the main path proceeds correctly. However, an edge from node5 to node6 in the CDFG incorrectly suggests continuing after return, which is impossible.

Step-by-step explanation:

1. The function starts by calculating iter = log2(n).
2. It initializes j=1 and doubles it until j exceeds iter.
3. If n isn't equal to j (i.e., not a power of two), returns 1 at node5.
4. If n is correct, proceeds with FFT computations.
5. The CDFG incorrectly connects node5 to node6, implying code continues after return, which is impossible.

Thus, any path through node5 â†’ node6 is static infeasibility.

Answer:

The infeasible paths are those attempting to proceed past a return statement. In the provided control flow graph, such a situation occurs if the edge from node5 to node6 exists, as it's impossible to continue after returning. This creates a static infeasible path.

\boxed{\text{There are no static infeasible paths beyond the early return condition. However, the CDFG incorrectly suggests continuing past a return statement, making that specific edge an example of dynamic infeasibility when n is not a power of two.}}
