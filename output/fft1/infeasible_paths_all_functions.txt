The analysis of the provided code snippet focuses on identifying static infeasible paths in each function's Control Data Flow Graph (CDFG). The detailed examination reveals that the primary issue lies within the 'fft1' function, where an impossible control flow edge exists after a return statement.

**Final Answer:**

\boxed{\text{The only static infeasible path is the edge from node5 to node6 in fft1's CDFG, representing an impossible continuation after a return statement.}}
