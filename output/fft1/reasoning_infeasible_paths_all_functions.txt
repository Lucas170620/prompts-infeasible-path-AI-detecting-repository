Okay, I need to analyze the provided code snippet and determine the static infeasible paths in each function's Control Data Flow Graph (CDFG). The user has already included some CDFGs for functions like fft1, cos, sin, etc., along with their analyses. My task is to follow a structured approach as outlined in the instructions.

First, I'll focus on the 'fft1' function because it seems complex and likely contains potential infeasible paths. The user's previous analysis pointed out an issue where after a return statement, the CDFG incorrectly suggests continuing with further code, which is impossible.

I remember that when a function returns, any subsequent code isn't executed. So if there's a path in the CDFG that goes from a node representing a return statement to another node, that edge should not exist because it's logically impossible to proceed after returning.

Looking at the 'fft1' function's CDFG, I see that node5 (where it returns 1) is connected to node6. This means the graph implies code execution continues after returning, which isn't possible. Therefore, this specific edge is an example of a static infeasible path because it violates the control flow rules.

To ensure thoroughness, I'll check other functions briefly:

- **cos**: The CDFG shows only two nodes with a direct return statement. No infeasible paths here since there's no branching or loops.
- **sin**: Similar to cos, straightforward with a single return. No issues.
- **fft1** as discussed.

I should also consider other potential static infeasibilities such as logical contradictions in conditions (like x > 0 and x < 0) or impossible loop exits. However, from the given CDFGs, only the fft1's edge after return stands out as an obvious violation.

In summary, the key static infeasible path is the connection from node5 to node6 in fft1's CDFG because it suggests continuing execution post-return.
