Okay, I need to generate a hybrid Control and Data Flow Graph (CDFG) in Graphviz DOT format for the `fabs` function provided. The function is written in C and looks like this:

```c
static double fabs(double n)
{
  double f;

  if (n >= 0) f = n;
  else f = -n;
  return f;
}
```

Let me break down the steps to create the CDFG accurately.

First, I'll identify all basic blocks in the function. The function starts with a declaration of `f`. Then there's an if-else statement which forms two basic blocks: one for the true case and another for the false case.

Each node in the graph should represent a basic block or control flow point. Nodes will be numbered sequentially, starting from 1.

For each node, I need to document the definitions (def) and uses (c-use/p-use). 

- Node 1: The entry of the function where `f` is declared.
- Node 2: The condition check `n >= 0`.
- Node 3: The true case where `f = n`.
- Node 4: The false case where `f = -n`.
- Node 5: The return statement.

Next, I'll map the control flow. The entry node (Node 1) flows into the condition check (Node 2). Depending on whether the condition is true or false, it proceeds to either Node 3 or Node 4. After processing in each case, both paths converge to the return statement (Node 5), which is the exit point.

For data flow:
- In Node 1: `f` is defined.
- In Node 2: The condition uses `n`.
- In Node 3: Uses `n` and defines `f`.
- In Node 4: Uses `n`, computes `-n`, and defines `f`.
- In Node 5: Uses `f` for the return.

I'll structure the graph with nodes as circles, except the start and end which can be double circles if needed. Each edge will have labels indicating conditions or control flow directions.

Now, I'll create the DOT code accordingly.
