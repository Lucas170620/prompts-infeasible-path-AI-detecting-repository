Okay, so I'm trying to create a Control and Data Flow Graph (CDFG) for the function `cos` in the provided code using Graphviz DOT notation. Let's start by understanding what the function does.

Looking at the code, the `cos` function takes a single argument `rad`, which is a double. The function calculates the cosine of this radian value by calling another function `sin` with the argument `(PI / 2.0 - rad)`. So essentially, it's using the identity that cos(x) = sin(π/2 - x).

First, I need to parse the code for the `cos` function. Let me write down each line and what it does.

The first line is:
```
double sin(double rad)
{
    double app;
```
Wait, no, actually, looking back, the `sin` function is defined inside `cos`. Wait, no—the provided code shows that `cos` calls a local `sin`, but in reality, both functions are static. Let me check the code again.

Wait, no, looking at the code:

The `main` function and other parts use standard functions like `log`, `sin`, `cos`, etc., but in the provided code, these functions are redefined as static.

So inside the file, we have:

- `static double fabs(double n)`
- `static double log(double n)`
- `static double sin(rad)` 
- `static double cos(double rad)`

Wait no, looking at the code snippet, the user actually included only part of it. But in the initial description, the function to analyze is `cos`, so I'll focus on that.

The provided `cos` function:

```
static double cos(double rad)
{
    double sin();

    return (sin(PI / 2.0 - rad));
}
```

Wait no, looking again, the user actually pasted a larger code file which includes several functions, including `sin`. But in this case, I need to focus only on the `cos` function.

So the `cos` function is as follows:

static double cos(double rad)
{
    return (sin(PI / 2.0 - rad));
}

Wait no, let me check again.

Looking back, the user provided a code snippet that includes multiple functions. The `cos` function is defined as:

static double cos(double rad)
{
    double sin();

    return (sin(PI / 2.0 - rad));
}

Wait no, actually, in the code, inside the `cos` function, it's calling another `sin` function.

So let me re-express that.

The function `cos` is as follows:

It takes a single argument `rad` of type double.

Inside, it declares a local function `double sin();`, but wait, no—that's not correct. Looking at the code:

Wait, in the code provided by the user, there's a `sin` function defined as static inside the same scope as `cos`. So both are static functions within the same translation unit.

So `cos` calls the local `sin` function with the argument `(PI / 2.0 - rad)`.

Thus, the execution of `cos` involves:

1. Taking `rad` as input.
2. Calculating `arg = PI/2.0 - rad`.
3. Passing this `arg` to the local `sin` function.
4. Returning the result of `sin(arg)`.

Now, I need to model the control flow and data flow for this function.

Let's start by identifying each statement as nodes in the CDFG.

The function starts at node 1:

1. Node 1: Begin of the function.
2. Then compute `PI/2.0 - rad` into a variable, say `arg`.
3. Call `sin(arg)` and return its value.

Wait, but looking again, the code is:

static double cos(double rad)
{
    double sin();

    return (sin(PI / 2.0 - rad));
}

Wait no, actually, in C, declaring a function inside another function isn't allowed unless using nested functions, which are not standard in C. So perhaps this is a mistake in the code.

Wait, looking at the user's code again, I see that they have defined `sin` as:

static double sin(rad)
double rad;
{
    // ... implementation
}

And then later, the function `cos` calls `sin`.

So in reality, the `cos` function is simply:

static double cos(double rad) {
    return (sin(M_PI/2.0 - rad));
}

Because the line inside the code was:
return (sin(PI / 2.0 - rad));

Wait, but no, looking at the user's code again, in the `cos` function:

static double cos(double rad)
{
    double sin();

    return (sin(PI / 2.0 - rad));
}

But this is incorrect because you can't declare a function inside another function in C.

Therefore, perhaps it's a mistake, and `cos` directly calls the global or local `sin` function.

Assuming that the code is correct except for the static declarations, I'll proceed under the assumption that `cos` correctly calls `sin`.

Now, let's outline the control flow:

- The function begins.
- Compute `arg = PI / 2.0 - rad`.
- Call `sin(arg)` and return its value.

So there are no conditional statements or loops in this function; it's a straightforward computation.

Each step is a single statement, so each will be a node in the CDFG.

Now, let's map out the nodes:

Node 1: Entry point of the function.
Node 2: Compute `arg = PI/2.0 - rad`.
Node 3: Call `sin(arg)` and return its value.

So there are three nodes in total.

But wait, node 1 is just the entry, so perhaps it's better to represent each executable statement as a node.

Wait, more precisely:

- Node 1: The function starts.
- Node 2: Compute the argument for `sin`.
- Node 3: Call `sin` with that argument.
- Node 4: Return the value from `sin`.

Alternatively, perhaps node 2 is computing the argument, node 3 is calling `sin`, and then returning.

But since in C, the return statement is a single line, it can be considered as one node.

So let's break down each step into nodes.

Now, for data flow:

- Node 1: Parameters `rad` are read.
- Node 2: Uses `rad` to compute `arg`.
- Node 3: Uses `arg` passed to `sin`.
- Node 4: Returns the result of `sin`.

But since it's a return statement, node 4 would be the exit.

Now, let's model this as nodes and edges.

Nodes:

1. Entry point.
2. Compute `arg = PI/2.0 - rad`.
3. Call `sin(arg)`.
4. Return value from `sin`.

Edges:

1 -> 2: Control flow.
2 -> 3: Control flow after computing arg.
3 -> 4: Control flow after getting result.

Now, in terms of data dependencies:

Node 1 has a definition of `rad` as a parameter.

Node 2 uses `rad` (a c-use) and defines `arg`.

Node 3 uses `arg` (c-use), and node 4 uses the return value from `sin`.

So each node will have labels indicating def and use of variables, along with their types (C-use or P-use).

Putting this together.

Now, for the CDFG:

Each node is represented as a circle with labels indicating the operation and any data dependencies.

For example:

Node 1: Entry. It defines `rad` (but wait, no—`rad` is passed in, so it's a use, not a def). So node 1 has c-use of `rad`.

Wait, but `rad` is an input parameter to the function. So in terms of data flow, node 1 uses `rad` as an argument.

Node 2: Computes `arg = PI/2 - rad`. So it defines `arg` and uses `rad`.

So:

- Node 1: C-use of `rad`.
- Node 2: Uses `rad` (c-use), defines `arg` (def).
- Node 3: Uses `arg` (c-use).
- Node 4: Returns the value, which is a def for the caller.

Now, let's structure each node with its label and data flow.

Node 1:
- Label: Entry point.
- Data: C-Use: rad.

Node 2:
- Compute arg = PI/2.0 - rad.
- Data: Def: arg; C-use: rad.

Node 3:
- Call sin(arg).
- Data: C-use: arg.

Node 4:
- Return the result of sin(arg).
- Data: Def: (return value).

But since node 4 is the exit, perhaps it's better to represent the function return as a terminal node with double circle.

Now, mapping this into the DOT notation:

Nodes:

1. [shape=circle, label="Entry", xlabel="C-Use: rad"]
2. [shape=circle, label="Compute arg", xlabel="Def: arg\nC-Use: rad"]
3. [shape=circle, label="Call sin(arg)", xlabel="C-Use: arg"]
4. [shape=doublecircle, label="Return"]

Edges:

1 -> 2
2 -> 3
3 -> 4

So the DOT code would look like this.

But let me make sure I'm capturing all data dependencies accurately.

Node 1:
- At entry, `rad` is available as an input. So it's a c-use of rad.

Node 2:
- Reads `rad`, computes arg, and defines arg.

Node 3:
- Uses arg to call sin.

Node 4:
- Returns the value from sin, which is the result.

Thus, each node's data flow is accurately captured.

Now, let's write this out in DOT notation.

Nodes:

1 [label="Entry", xlabel="C-Use: rad"];
2 [label="Compute arg = PI/2.0 - rad", xlabel="Def: arg\nC-Use: rad"];
3 [label="Call sin(arg)", xlabel="C-Use: arg"];
4 [shape=doublecircle, label="Return"];

Edges:

1 -> 2;
2 -> 3;
3 -> 4;

So the complete DOT code would be:

```
digraph cos {
    rankdir=TB;
    node [shape=circle];
    
    1 [label="Entry", xlabel="C-Use: rad"];
    2 [label="Compute arg = PI/2.0 - rad", xlabel="Def: arg\nC-Use: rad"];
    3 [label="Call sin(arg)", xlabel="C-Use: arg"];
    4 [shape=doublecircle, label="Return"];
    
    1 -> 2;
    2 -> 3;
    3 -> 4;
}
```

Now, for the second part, I need to list each node with its corresponding code snippet.

Node 1:
The function starts. It uses `rad` as an input parameter.
Code: (Implicitly at entry)

Node 2:
Compute arg = PI/2.0 - rad.
Code: double arg = PI / 2.0 - rad;

Node 3:
Call sin(arg) and return its value.
Code: return sin(PI / 2.0 - rad);

Wait, but in the function as provided by the user, it's:

return (sin(PI / 2.0 - rad));

So perhaps node 2 is not necessary because the computation is done inline.

Wait, looking back at the code:

The `cos` function in the user's code is written as:

static double cos(double rad)
{
    return (sin(PI / 2.0 - rad));
}

Ah! So there's no intermediate variable; it directly calls sin with the computed argument.

So perhaps I overcomplicated it earlier by thinking there was an arg variable, but in reality, the function is a single line that computes and returns.

Therefore, the `cos` function has only two steps:

1. Entry.
2. Compute sin(PI/2 - rad) and return.

Thus, the CDFG will have fewer nodes.

Let me reevaluate.

The function `cos` is as follows:

static double cos(double rad)
{
    return (sin(PI / 2.0 - rad));
}

So in this case, node 1 is the entry point, and node 2 is the return statement which involves computing sin(PI/2 - rad).

Thus, only two nodes.

Node 1: Entry.
Node 2: Compute and return.

Data flow:

- Node 1 uses `rad` (c-use).
- Node 2 uses `rad` to compute the argument for sin.

But perhaps we can represent this with a single node after entry.

Wait, but in terms of control flow, it's still two steps.

So nodes:

Node 1: Entry point.
Node 2: Return statement which computes and returns.

Thus, edges: 1 -> 2; 2 is the exit (double circle).

Data dependencies:

- Node 1: C-use of rad.
- Node 2: Uses rad to compute sin(PI/2 - rad), c-use of rad.

So the DOT code would be:

```
digraph cos {
    rankdir=TB;
    node [shape=circle];
    
    1 [label="Entry", xlabel="C-Use: rad"];
    2 [label="Return sin(PI/2 - rad)", xlabel="C-Use: rad"];
    2 [shape=doublecircle];
    
    1 -> 2;
}
```

But perhaps to better represent the computation, node 2 could have a more detailed label.

Alternatively, perhaps node 2 can be considered as:

Node 2: Compute and return sin(PI/2 - rad).

Thus, combining everything into one node after entry.

So, considering that, the CDFG will have two nodes.

Now, for the code snippets:

Node 1:
The function starts.
Code: (Entry)

Node 2:
Compute and return sin(PI / 2.0 - rad).
Code: return sin(PI / 2.0 - rad);

Thus, in the codigos section:

<codigos - cos>
Node 1:
The function begins.
---
Node 2:
return sin(M_PI/2.0 - rad);
</codigos>

So putting it all together.

Final DOT code:

```
digraph cos {
    rankdir=TB;
    node [shape=circle];
    
    1 [label="Entry", xlabel="C-Use: rad"];
    2 [label="Return sin(PI/2 - rad)", xlabel="C-Use: rad"];
    2 [shape=doublecircle];
    
    1 -> 2;
}
```

And the code snippets:

<codigos - cos>
Node 1:
The function begins.
---
Node 2:
return sin(M_PI / 2.0 - rad);
</codigos>

Wait, but M_PI is a macro; in the user's code, it's PI which is defined as static. Looking back at the provided code:

In the `sin` function, they use PI which is a local variable? Wait no, looking again.

Wait, in the `sin` function, the code defines:

static double sin(double rad)
double app;
double tolerance = 0.0001;
double diff;

// ... implementation

But actually, the user's code snippet might have typos or formatting issues.

In any case, for `cos`, the important part is that it calls `sin` with a computed argument based on `rad`.

Therefore, in the CDFG, node 2 uses `rad` and computes the sin function.
