Okay, I need to generate a hybrid Control and Data Flow Graph (CDFG) for the given function fft1 using Graphviz DOT. The user provided specific instructions on how to structure this graph, so I'll follow those closely.

First, I'll go through the code step by step to understand its control flow and data usage. 

The function starts with checking if n is less than 2 and returns an error code if true. Then it calculates iter using log(n)/log(2). It initializes j to 1 and multiplies it by 2 iter times, ensuring that j equals n. If not, it returns an error.

Next, the main FFT loops are executed. There's a sign variable based on the flag, and then nested loops for xp, k, and j. Inside these loops, trigonometric functions are used to compute wr and wi, which are then applied in complex number operations.

After the loops, there's a digit reverse counter loop that swaps elements in ar and ai arrays based on conditions. Finally, if flag is 0, it normalizes the results by dividing each element by n.

I'll identify all basic blocks, map definitions and uses of variables, and then construct the CDFG with nodes for each process, decisions, and loops. Each node will have labels indicating definitions, computational uses, and predicate uses. The graph should show control flow with edges labeled by conditions where applicable.

I need to ensure that each node is numbered sequentially, and the mapping between code lines and nodes is clear in the second part of the output.
