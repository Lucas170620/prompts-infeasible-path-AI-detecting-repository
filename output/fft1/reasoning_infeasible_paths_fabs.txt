Alright, let's tackle this problem step by step. I'm supposed to analyze the provided code and its CDFG to identify infeasible paths. The code is a function called `fabs` which computes the absolute value of a double. Let me start by understanding the code and then map it to the given CDFG.

First, looking at the `fabs` function:

```c
static double fabs(double n)
{
  double f;

  if (n >= 0) 
    f = n;
  else 
    f = -n;
  return f;
}
```

This is straightforward. It checks if `n` is non-negative; if so, it assigns `n` to `f`, otherwise, it takes the negation of `n`. Then it returns `f`.

Now, looking at the CDFG provided in the question:

```dot
digraph fabs {
    rankdir=TB;
    node [shape=circle];
    
    1 [label="1", xlabel="Def: f\nC-Use: n"];
    2 [label="2", xlabel="P-Use: n"];
    3 [label="3", xlabel="Def: f = n\nC-Use: n"];
    4 [label="4", xlabel="Def: f = -n\nC-Use: n"];
    5 [label="5", shape=doublecircle, xlabel="Return f\nC-Use: f"];

    1 -> 2;
    2 -> 3 [label="True\n(n >= 0)"];
    2 -> 4 [label="False"];
    3 -> 5;
    4 -> 5;
}
```

From the CDFG, I can see that there are five nodes:

1. Node 1: Definition of `f` and use of `n`.
2. Node 2: Use of `n` in an if condition.
3. Node 3: Definition of `f = n`; uses `n`.
4. Node 4: Definition of `f = -n`; uses `n`.
5. Node 5: Return statement, returns `f`.

The edges represent the control flow:

- From node 2, it branches to node 3 if true (when `n >=0`) and to node 4 if false.

Now, the task is to identify infeasible paths in this CDFG.

Let me map each node to the code lines. 

Node 1 corresponds to line where `f` is declared.
Node 2 corresponds to the condition `if (n >=0)`.
Nodes 3 and 4 are the assignments inside the if-else blocks.
Node 5 is the return statement.

Now, let's list all possible paths:

1. True branch: Node 2 → Node 3 → Node 5
   - Code lines: Line with `if (n >=0)`, then assigning `f = n`, then returning `f`.

2. False branch: Node 2 → Node4 → Node5
   - Assigning `f = -n` and then returning.

Since the function is straightforward, let me check for any infeasible paths.

An infeasible path would be a control flow that can never execute due to logical contradictions or impossible conditions.

Looking at the condition node (node2), it's checking if `n >=0`. Depending on this, either node3 or node4 executes. Both are mutually exclusive because the if-else structure ensures only one branch is taken.

Now, let me check each possible path:

1. Path through Node 2 → Node3 → Node5:
   - This happens when `n >=0`.
   - The assignment `f = n` is valid.
   - Then return `f`, which is correct.

2. Path through Node2 → Node4 → Node5:
   - When `n <0`.
   - Assigns `f = -n`, making it positive.
   - Return `f`.

Both paths are logically consistent and there's no contradiction in either path because each condition ensures the appropriate assignment.

Now, considering data dependencies: All variables (`n` and `f`) are properly initialized. There's no case where a variable is used before being defined, except for `f`, which is always assigned in both branches before returning.

Another point to check: Are there any impossible conditions? For example, can `n` be both >=0 and <0 at the same time? No, because it's mutually exclusive. So each branch correctly handles its own case.

Is there a scenario where neither branch could execute? That would happen if `n` is somehow invalid, but in C, any double value is valid, so that can't happen.

Therefore, both paths are feasible under different conditions. There are no infeasible paths because the control flow correctly partitions based on the condition and both branches lead to valid executions.
