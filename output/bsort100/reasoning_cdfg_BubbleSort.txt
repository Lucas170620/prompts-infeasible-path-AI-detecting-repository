Okay, so I need to generate a Control and Data Flow Graph (CDFG) for the BubbleSort function in the given code using Graphviz DOT format. Let me start by understanding what CDFG entails.

First, I'll read through the provided code to get familiar with it. The main function calls Initialize and BubbleSort. Since the task is about BubbleSort, I'll focus on that function.

BubbleSort starts with setting Sorted to FALSE. Then there's a loop for i from 1 to NUMELEMS-1. Inside this loop, another loop for Index starting at 1 up to NUMELEMS-1. There's an if condition checking if Array[Index] > Array[Index+1], swapping elements if true and setting Sorted to FALSE. If no swaps happen in a pass, it breaks out early.

Now, I need to break down the BubbleSort function into basic blocks. Basic blocks are sequences of instructions with a single entry point and exit. So each conditional is a potential split.

Looking at the code:

1. The outer loop starts with i=1.
2. Inside, Sorted is set to TRUE before each inner loop.
3. The inner loop runs from Index=1 to NUMELEMS-1, but breaks if Index > NUMELEMS -i.
4. For each iteration, it checks if Array[Index] > Array[Index+1]. If so, swaps and sets Sorted to FALSE.
5. After the inner loop, if Sorted is TRUE, break out of outer loop.

So, breaking into basic blocks:

- Node 1: i starts at 1, check condition for loop.
- Node 2: enter outer loop body. Initialize Sorted = TRUE.
- Node 3: start inner loop with Index=1.
- Node 4: check if Index > NUMELEMS -i to break.
- Node 5: compare Array[Index] and Array[Index+1].
- Node 6: swap elements, set Sorted to FALSE.
- Node 7: after the if block, check if Sorted is TRUE to decide whether to continue inner loop.
- Then, after inner loop, check if Sorted is TRUE to break outer loop.

Wait, but in code, it's structured as:

for (i=1; i <= NUMELEMS-1; i++) {
    Sorted = TRUE;
    for (Index=1; ...) {
        ...
    }
    if (Sorted) break;
}

So each iteration of the outer loop involves the inner loop and then checking Sorted.

I think I need to represent each step in the control flow. Let me outline each node:

1. Start with i initialization and condition check.
2. Enter outer loop body, set Sorted=TRUE.
3. Inner loop starts: Index initialization and condition.
4. Check if Index > NUMELEMS-i (if so, break).
5. Compare Array[Index] and next element.
6. If greater, swap and mark as unsorted.
7. Continue inner loop until end or break.
8. After inner loop, check if Sorted is TRUE to break outer loop.

Each of these steps can be a node in the CDFG.

Now, for each node, I'll note the definitions (def) and uses (use). Definitions are where variables are assigned new values; uses are where they're read.

Node 1: i = 1. Def: i. Uses: none.
Node 2: enter loop body. Sorted=TRUE. Def: Sorted. Use: none.
Wait, noâ€”each node is a basic block, so perhaps each statement within the same control flow is in one node.

Alternatively, maybe I should split at each potential jump point (like after each condition check). So:

- Node 1: i starts, loop condition checked.
- Node 2: enter outer loop. Set Sorted=TRUE.
- Node 3: Index starts, inner loop condition.
- Node 4: check if Index > NUMELEMS -i.
- Node 5: compare Array[Index] and next element.
- Node 6: swap elements and set Sorted=FALSE.
- Node 7: after swap, continue loop or not?
Wait, in code, after the swap, it just continues. So maybe node 5 leads to node 6 (swap) then back to node 4? Or perhaps nodes are structured with conditionals.

Alternatively, perhaps I should represent each conditional as a decision point, leading to different flows.

This is getting complex. Maybe using a tool would help, but since I'm doing it manually, I'll proceed step by step.

Let me outline the code structure:

for (i = 1; i <= NUMELEMS-1; i++) {
    Sorted = TRUE;
    for (Index = 1; Index <= NUMELEMS-1; Index++) {
        if (Index > NUMELEMS - i)
            break;
        if (Array[Index] > Array[Index+1]) {
            swap elements;
            Sorted = FALSE;
        }
    }
    if (Sorted) break;
}

So the control flow is:

Start of function.

i loop:
- Initialize i to 1.
- Check condition for i. If true, proceed; else, exit.
- Enter outer loop body: set Sorted=TRUE.
- Index loop starts:
   - Initialize Index to 1.
   - Check if Index > NUMELEMS -i. If yes, break inner loop.
   - Compare Array[Index] and next element.
      - If greater, swap and mark as not sorted.
   - Continue until end of inner loop or break.
- After inner loop, check if Sorted is TRUE. If so, break outer loop.

So the basic blocks would be:

1. i initialization and condition check (entry node).
2. Set Sorted=TRUE.
3. Index initialization and condition check.
4. Break from inner loop due to Index > limit.
5. Compare elements.
6. Swap and set Sorted=FALSE.
7. After swap, continue in inner loop or exit?
Wait, the code doesn't have an explicit 'continue', so after swapping, it just proceeds to next Index.

So each condition is a node with possible branches.

I'll represent each decision point as a node with two edges: one for true and one for false.

Let's try to map this:

Nodes:

1. Start of BubbleSort function.
2. i loop initialization (i=1) and condition check (i <= NUMELEMS-1).
3. Enter outer loop body: Sorted = TRUE.
4. Inner loop initialization (Index=1) and condition (<= NUMELEMS-1).
5. Check if Index > NUMELEMS -i. If true, break inner loop.
6. Compare Array[Index] and Array[Index+1].
7a. Swap elements and set Sorted to FALSE.
7b. Continue to next Index.
8. After the inner loop (either by natural end or break), check if Sorted is TRUE. If so, break outer loop.

Wait, perhaps it's better to split into more nodes for clarity:

- Node 1: Enter BubbleSort.
- Node 2: Check i condition; enter outer loop.
- Node 3: Set Sorted=TRUE.
- Node 4: Check Index condition; enter inner loop.
- Node 5: Check if Index > NUMELEMS -i. If yes, break to node A (after inner loop).
- Node 6: Compare elements. If greater, proceed to swap and set Sorted=FALSE.
- Node 7: Swap and mark as unsorted.
- Node 8: Continue inner loop or exit?
Wait, after swapping, the code doesn't have a continue; it continues with next Index.

Alternatively:

After node 5 (if Index > limit), break to node 4? Or proceed?

I'm getting stuck. Maybe I should try numbering each line as nodes and define their control flow.

Let's list all lines in BubbleSort function:

Line numbers:

1: for (i = 1; i <= NUMELEMS-1; i++) {
2:     Sorted = TRUE;
3:     for (Index = 1; Index <= NUMELEMS-1; Index++) {
4:         if (Index > NUMELEMS - i)
5:             break;
6:         if (Array[Index] > Array[Index+1]) {
7:             Temp = Array[Index];
8:             Array[Index] = Array[Index+1];
9:             Array[Index+1] = Temp;
10:            Sorted = FALSE;
11:        }
12:     }
13:     if (Sorted)
14:         break;
15: }

So each line is a node, but perhaps grouped into basic blocks.

But for CDFG, we need to represent each statement and the data flow between them.

Wait, perhaps it's better to split at conditionals.

Starting from the top:

- Enter function (node 1).
- Start i loop: check condition (i <= NUMELEMS-1). If not, exit. So node 2.
- If enter loop, set Sorted=TRUE (node 3).
- Start inner Index loop: check condition (Index <= NUMELEMS-1). Node 4.
- Check if Index > NUMELEMS -i: break to end of inner loop (node5).
- Compare Array[Index] and next element (node6).
   If true, swap elements and set Sorted=FALSE (nodes7-9).
   Then proceed to next iteration (no jump).
- After the inner loop ends, check if Sorted is TRUE (node10). If so, break outer loop.

Wait, but in code:

After line 3's for loop starts, it runs until line 12, then after that comes line 13's if statement.

So perhaps each block is:

Node 2: i loop condition check.
If true:
   Node 3: Sorted = TRUE.
   Node4: Index loop condition check.
      If true:
         Node5: Index > limit? break to node6.
         Else:
            Node6: compare Array[Index] and next element.
               If greater:
                  Nodes7-9: swap and set Sorted=FALSE.
            Then proceed (no further action, continue loop)
   After inner loop, check if Sorted is TRUE. If so, break outer loop.

Wait, but the inner loop continues until Index reaches its limit or breaks due to condition.

I think I'm complicating it too much. Let me try a different approach: represent each statement as a node and connect them with edges based on control flow.

Each time there's a conditional (if), create a decision node that branches true/false.

So:

Node1: Enter BubbleSort.
Node2: Check i loop condition (i <= NUMELEMS-1). If false, exit.
Edge: Node1 -> Node2 [label="TRUE"]
But wait, initial i is set to 1. So perhaps Node2 represents the condition after i=1.

Alternatively, maybe:

Node0: Enter function.
Node1: Check if i > NUMELEMS-1 (initially false). If not, proceed.
So edge from Node0 -> Node1 [label="not >"] which is true initially.

But this can get complicated. Maybe it's better to use a tool, but since I'm doing it manually, perhaps I should outline the main nodes and their connections.

Another approach: consider that each loop and conditional creates a node with possible branches.

Let me try:

- Node A: i = 1; check if i <= NUMELEMS-1.
   - If yes (edge A1), proceed to set Sorted=TRUE.
   - Else (A2), exit function.

- Node B: Set Sorted=TRUE.
   Next, enter inner loop:
      Node C: Index =1; check if Index <= NUMELEMS-1.
         - Yes (C1): proceed.
         - No (C2): exit inner loop.

      If proceed (C1):
         Node D: Check if Index > NUMELEMS -i.
            - Yes (D1): break to end of inner loop.
            - No (D2): compare elements.

         Node E: Compare Array[Index] and next element.
             - If greater (E1): swap and mark unsorted.
                Node F: swap, set Sorted=FALSE. After that, continue loop (back to C? Or proceed to D again? Or increment Index in the loop's mechanism.)

Wait, perhaps after F, it goes back to C since inner loop increments Index automatically.

After the compare, if not greater, just proceed without changes.

So node E has:

- Edge E1: swap and set Sorted=FALSE. Then go to node G (after this is done).
- Edge E2: no swap. Go to node G.

Node G is after F or E2, which represents the end of inner loop iteration, leading back to condition check C.

But loops are a bit tricky because they involve jumping back.

Alternatively, perhaps each loop is represented with entry and exit nodes.

This is getting too involved. Maybe I should refer to standard control flow graph construction for this code snippet.

In summary, for each conditional statement (if), create a node that branches into two paths based on the condition being true or false. Each assignment creates a new node if it affects subsequent control flow.

For data flow:

Each variable is used where they are read and defined where assigned.

So for each node, I'll note which variables are used (use) and which are defined (def).

Starting with Node A: i=1; check condition.

Use: none. Def: i.

Then Node B: enter outer loop body if condition met. Here, Sorted is set to TRUE.

Def: Sorted.

Node C: Index =1; check inner loop condition.

Def: Index.

And so on.

Putting it all together, each node will have uses and defs:

- Node A: def(i)
- Node B: def(Sorted)
- Node C: def(Index)
- Node D: use(Index), use(i)
- Node E: use(Index), use(Array), use(Index+1)
- Node F: def(Temp), def(Array[Index]), def(Array[Index+1]), def(Sorted)
- etc.

But perhaps this is too detailed for the initial outline. The main goal is to connect the nodes with edges based on control flow and represent data dependencies as well.

In terms of visualizing, each node will have incoming edges from previous nodes and outgoing edges leading to where the code continues or branches.

Now, to write out the code in pseudocode:

function BubbleSort() {
    for (i = 1; i <= N-1; i++) { // Node A
        Sorted = TRUE; // Node B
        for (Index = 1; Index <= N-1; Index++) { // Node C
            if (Index > N - i) break; // Node D
            if (Array[Index] > Array[Index+1]) { // Node E
                swap elements; // Node F
                Sorted = FALSE; // Part of Node F
            }
        }
        if (Sorted) break; // Node G
    }
}

So the control flow graph would look like:

A -> B (execute outer loop)
B -> C (enter inner loop)
C -> D (check break condition in inner loop)
D has two edges: one for breaking to after inner loop, another for continuing.
If breaks, goes to node G; else, proceed to E.

E has two edges: swap or not.
If swap (F), then after F, back to C's next iteration.
Wait, but loops automatically increment Index and check condition again.

Alternatively, perhaps after each iteration of the inner loop, it returns to checking the condition at D.

I think I'm overcomplicating it. To keep it manageable, I'll proceed with a simplified version where each conditional is a node with two outgoing edges, and each assignment is part of a node that leads to the next statement.

So in terms of nodes:

1. Enter function.
2. i loop condition check (i <= N-1). If not, exit.
3. Set Sorted=TRUE.
4. Index loop condition (Index <= N-1). If not, break inner loop.
5. Check if Index > N-i: if yes, break inner loop.
6. Compare Array[Index] and next element.
   a. If greater, swap elements and mark as unsorted.
7. After all Index iterations, check if Sorted is TRUE to break outer loop.

But I'm not capturing the exact flow correctly because after each iteration of the inner loop, it goes back to check the condition again.

Perhaps using a standard control flow approach where loops have entry and exit points:

- For i loop:
   - Entry: node A
   - Body starts at node B (set Sorted=TRUE)
      which leads to Index loop.

- For Index loop:
   - Entry: node C
   - Condition check: node D
      which can either break or proceed.
      If break, go to node E (after inner loop).
   - If proceed, compare elements in node F.
      Then, if swap, mark as unsorted in node G.

- After Index loop completes, check Sorted at node H. If true, break outer loop; else, continue.

I think that's a manageable way to structure the nodes and their connections.

In terms of data flow:

Each node will have uses (variables read) and defs (assigned variables).

So mapping:

Node A: i <= N-1? Use(i)
Node B: Sorted = TRUE. Def(Sorted)
Node C: Index <= N-1. Use(Index)
Node D: Index > N -i. Use(Index, i). If true, break to node E.
Node F: Array[Index] and Array[Index+1]. Compare.
   If greater:
      Node G: swap and set Sorted=FALSE. Def(Temp, Array[Index], Array[Index+1], Sorted)
Node H: After inner loop ends, check if Sorted is TRUE. Use(Sorted). If yes, break.

So each node has edges leading to other nodes based on conditions.

In the end, the CDFG will consist of these nodes connected as per control flow and data dependencies.

I think I've thought through this enough. Now, perhaps I should try to write out a textual representation or describe it in terms of nodes and edges with their labels.
