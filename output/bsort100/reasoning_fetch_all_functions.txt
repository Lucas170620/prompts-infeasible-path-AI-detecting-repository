Okay, I need to analyze the given C code and extract all the user-defined function names. Let me look through the code carefully.

Starting from the top, I see some preprocessor directives and includes. Then there's a main() function declared. That's definitely one function.

Next, there are two functions: Initialize(Array) and BubbleSort(Array). Those are clearly function declarations. So that's three so farâ€”main, Initialize, BubbleSort.

Looking further down, there's a function called ttime(). Another one. Now we have four functions.

I don't see any other function definitions in the code. The rest of the code is either comments, variable declarations, or loops within the functions already identified.

So the user-defined functions are: main, Initialize, BubbleSort, and ttime.
