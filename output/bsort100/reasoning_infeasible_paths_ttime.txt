Okay, so I need to analyze the provided code and its Control Flow Data Flow Graph (CDFG) to identify any infeasible paths. Let's start by understanding what each part does.

The function `ttime()` is supposed to return the time in milliseconds. Looking at the code:

1. It declares two variables: a struct tms buffer and an integer utime.
2. There's a commented-out line where it would call times(&buffer); which isn't implemented, so that line is skipped.
3. Then, utime is calculated using buffer.tms_utime divided by 60.0, multiplied by 1000.0.
4. Finally, utime is returned.

The CDFG provided has three nodes and an exit node. Let me map each part of the code to these nodes:

- Node 1: Starts with variable declarations (buffer and utime). It defines both variables.
- Node 2: Computes utime using buffer.tms_utime. This uses buffer's field tms_utime (C-use) and defines utime.
- Node 3: Returns utime, which is a P-use of utime.
- Exit node: Marks the end.

Now, I need to find potential paths through this CDFG. Since it's sequential, the only path is 1 → 2 → 3 → exit.

Let me check each step for infeasibility:

1. Node 1 initializes both variables. No issues here.
2. Node 2 accesses buffer.tms_utime and assigns to utime. The problem is that times(&buffer) isn't called, so buffer might not be initialized. This means buffer.tms_utime could have garbage values or undefined behavior.

Wait, in C, if struct tms isn't properly initialized before accessing its members, it's undefined behavior. So using buffer.tms_utime without calling times() is invalid.

So, the path 1 → 2 → 3 uses a possibly uninitialized buffer. This makes the entire path infeasible because the data is unreliable. Since this is static (always true), it's statically infeasible due to undefined behavior.

Therefore, all paths are affected by this issue, making them invalid.
