Okay, I need to create a precise Hybrid Control and Data Flow Graph (CDFG) in Graphviz DOT format for the function `num_to_lcd` provided. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this graph, including nodes with labels, shapes, and edge conditions. They also want a mapping from code snippets to their corresponding nodes.

First, I'll analyze the function `num_to_lcd`. It's a switch statement that returns different values based on the input 'a'. The cases are 0x00 to 0x0F. Each case has an assignment to 'return' with specific bitwise operations or literals.

I need to break this function into basic blocks. Each case in the switch will be a separate block, except for the default case which isn't present here. Each case's execution is sequential and doesn't have any loops or complex control flow beyond the switch itself.

Next, I'll identify all the data definitions (def) and uses (c-use/p-use). For each node, I'll note what variables are defined or used in that block. Since 'a' is the input variable, it's only used here as a condition for each case.

Now, constructing the CDFG: Each case will be a node with a specific label indicating the operation. The edges between nodes will represent the control flow based on the conditions of the switch cases. For example, if the function enters case 0x00, it returns; similarly, other cases do the same.

I'll assign each node a unique ID and describe their labels and shapes. Since this is a function without loops or complex structures beyond the switch, each node will be a box representing processing steps. The exit node will have a double circle to denote the end.

For the mapping part, I'll list each code snippet corresponding to its node, ensuring that every case in the switch is accounted for with their respective labels and IDs.

I need to make sure the graph uses 'rankdir=TB' for vertical layout and properly labels edges with conditions. Each edge will represent the control flow based on whether a particular case is executed or not.

Finally, I'll structure the DOT code, define each node with appropriate labels and shapes, connect them with directed edges representing control flows, and provide the mapping of code snippets to their respective nodes.
