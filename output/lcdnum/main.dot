The problem requires constructing a Control Flow Graph (CFG) for a given code snippet. The code initializes `n` to 10 and then enters a loop that runs while `i` is less than `n`. Inside the loop, it reads a value into `a`, checks if `i` is less than 5, and processes `a` accordingly.

### Step-by-Step Explanation:

1. **Node 1: Initialization of n**
   - **Code:** `n = 10;`
   - **Defs:** `{n}`
   - **Uses:** `None`

2. **Node 2: Loop Initialization**
   - **Code:** `for (i = 0; i < n; i++) { ... }`
   - **Defs:** `{i}` (initialized to 0)
   - **Uses:** `None`

3. **Node 3: Loop Condition Check**
   - **Code:** `if (i < n) { ... } else { return; }`
   - **Uses:** `{i, n}`
   - **Outgoing Edges:**
     - If true → Node 4
     - If false → Return (exit function)

4. **Node 4: Read IN into a**
   - **Code:** `a = IN;`
   - **Defs:** `{a}`
   - **Uses:** `{IN}`

5. **Node 5: Check if i < 5**
   - **Code:** `if (i < 5) { ... } else { continue; }`
   - **Uses:** `{i}`
   - **Outgoing Edges:**
     - If true → Node 6
     - If false → Exit loop body and proceed to next iteration

6. **Node 6: Process a**
   - **Code:**
     ```
     a = a & 0x0F;
     OUT = func(a);
     ```
   - **Defs:** `{a, OUT}`
   - **Uses:** `{a}` (and implicitly `OUT` is used)

7. **Flow Control After Node 6:**
   - **Edge from Node 6 to Node 3:**
     - Represents the completion of processing and returning to check the loop condition again after incrementing `i`.

8. **Return Statement:**
   - **Code:** `return;`
   - **Defs:** `{none}`
   - **Uses:** `{none}`

### Summary:
- The graph starts with initializing `n` and then entering a loop.
- Each iteration reads a value into `a`, checks if `i` is less than 5, processes `a` if true, and continues looping until `i` reaches `n`.
- Nodes represent specific code operations, and edges show control flow based on conditions.

This structured approach ensures each part of the code is represented accurately in the Control Flow Graph.
