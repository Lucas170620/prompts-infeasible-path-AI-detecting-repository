Okay, I need to analyze the given code and identify any infeasible paths based on the provided Control Data Flow Graphs (CDFGs) for both `num_to_lcd` and `main` functions. 

Starting with `num_to_lcd`, looking at its CDFG, I see that each case in the switch statement returns a value immediately. The final return after all cases is unreachable because once any case is hit, the function exits. So, any path leading to the last return (Node 18) after a case is definitely infeasible.

Now, looking at the `main` function's CDFG, I don't see any obvious contradictions or impossible paths. The loop runs up to n=10, and within each iteration, it processes 'a' if i <5. There are no conflicting conditions or deadlocks in the flow, so no infeasible paths here.

So, the only infeasible paths are in `num_to_lcd` where reaching Node 18 is impossible after any case is executed.
