To solve this problem, we need to generate a Control and Data Flow Graph (CDFG) in Graphviz DOT format for the `Test` function provided. The function initializes two matrices, multiplies them, and measures the time taken for the multiplication. However, due to conditional compilation, certain parts related to timing and output are excluded when running under specific conditions.

### Approach
1. **Identify Functionality**: The `Test` function initializes matrices A and B, then calls the `Multiply` function with these matrices and another matrix Res.
2. **Basic Blocks**: Break down the function into basic blocks:
   - Initialization of matrix A.
   - Initialization of matrix B.
   - Multiplication of matrices A, B, and storing the result in Res.
3. **Data Flow Analysis**:
   - Track computational uses (C-Use) and definitions (Def) for each variable involved.
4. **Control Flow**: The function has a sequential control flow with no branches or loops.
5. **Graph Representation**: Represent each basic block as a node, and connect them with edges to show both control flow and data dependencies.

### Solution Code
```graphviz
digraph TestFunctionCDFG {
    node1 [label="Initialize(A)\nC-Use: A\nDef: A"];
    node2 [label="Initialize(B)\nC-Use: B\nDef: B"];
    node3 [label="Multiply(A,B,Res)\nC-Use: A, B, Res\nDef: Res"];

    // Control flow edges
    node1 -> node2;
    node2 -> node3;

    // Data flow edges (labeled with variable names)
    node1 -> node3 [label="A"];
    node2 -> node3 [label="B"];
}
```

### Explanation
- **Nodes**: Each node represents a basic block of the function:
  - `node1` initializes matrix A.
  - `node2` initializes matrix B.
  - `node3` multiplies matrices A, B, and stores the result in Res.
- **Control Flow Edges**: The arrows from `node1` to `node2` and `node2` to `node3` represent the sequential execution of the function.
- **Data Flow Edges**: Arrows labeled with variable names show dependencies between nodes:
  - Matrix A from `node1` is used in `node3`.
  - Matrix B from `node2` is used in `node3`.

This graph provides a clear visual representation of both the control flow and data dependencies within the `Test` function, facilitating understanding of its execution and variable usage.
