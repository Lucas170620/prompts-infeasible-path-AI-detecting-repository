Okay, I need to analyze the provided Multiply function and its CDFG to identify any infeasible paths. Let me start by understanding both the code and the CDFG.

First, looking at the Multiply function:

The function multiplies two matrices A and B, storing the result in Res. It has three nested loops: outer loop for rows of A, inner loop for columns of B, and another loop for multiplying elements. There are no conditional branches except the loop conditions.

Now, examining the CDFG provided. The nodes represent basic blocks or operations, and edges show control flow. Nodes include Start, various loops with conditions (like if statements), and operations like initializing Res[Outer][Inner] to 0 and performing the multiplication.

Since the Multiply function has no conditional branches except for loop conditions, all paths should be feasible as long as the loop indices behave as expected. But I need to check each path to see if any are infeasible due to logical contradictions or data dependencies.

Let me list possible paths:

1. The outermost loop starts with Outer=0 and continues while Outer < UPPERLIMIT.
2. For each Outer, the Inner loop starts at 0 and runs similarly.
3. Inside the Inner loop, Res is initialized to 0 for each element.
4. Then, Index starts at 0 and loops through all elements, performing the multiplication.

Since all these are loops without any conditionals except for the loop boundaries, every path should be taken as long as Outer, Inner, and Index indices stay within bounds.

But let's think about possible infeasible paths. Are there any conditions that can't be met? For example, if an index goes beyond the array size, but since all loops are controlled by UPPERLIMIT, which is a fixed 20, this shouldn't happen as long as the function is called correctly.

Another point: Variables like Outer, Inner, and Index are all properly initialized before the loops. So no uninitialized variables here.

Looking at data dependencies: Each index variable is used within their respective loops without any conflicts. For example, Outer increments only after processing an entire inner loop iteration, which follows standard matrix multiplication logic.

Are there any logical contradictions? Since each condition in the loops (e.g., Index < UPPERLIMIT) is straightforward and non-contradictory with previous operations, I don't see any paths where a condition would be impossible to meet based on prior assignments.

Therefore, all possible paths through the CDFG are feasible. There's no path that leads to an impossible state because all conditions are checked correctly within their respective loops.
