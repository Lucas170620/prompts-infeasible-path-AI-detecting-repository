The Control and Data Flow Graph (CDFG) for the `InitSeed` function consists of two nodes. The first node represents the assignment of Seed to 0, and the second node is the exit point.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Function Analysis:** The `InitSeed` function initializes the global variable `Seed` to zero. It contains a single statement without any control flow structures (no loops or branches).

2. **Basic Blocks:** Since there's only one statement, it forms a single basic block.

3. **Data Flow:**
   - **Definition (Def):** The assignment `Seed = 0;` defines the variable `Seed`.
   - **Use (C-Use):** There are no computational uses of variables in this statement since the right-hand side is a constant.

4. **Control Flow:** The function starts at the assignment, then exits without any branches or loops.

5. **Graph Structure:**
   - Node 1 represents the assignment and includes the definition of `Seed`.
   - Node 2 is the exit node, represented as a double circle.

**CDFG Representation:**

```graphviz
digraph InitSeed {
    rankdir=TB;
    
    node [shape=circle];
    
    1 [label="1", xlabel="Def: Seed\nC-Use: None"];
    2 [label="", shape=doublecircle];
    
    1 -> 2;
}
```

**Mapping of Nodes to Code Lines:**

- **Node 1:** Line `Seed = 0;` â†’ Defines `Seed`.
- **Node 2:** Exit point.

This graph accurately represents the control and data flow for the `InitSeed` function.
