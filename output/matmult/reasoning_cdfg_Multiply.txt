Okay, I need to generate a Control and Data Flow Graph (CDFG) in Graphviz DOT format for the Multiply function provided. Let me start by understanding the code and then break down each step.

First, looking at the Multiply function:

void Multiply(matrix A, matrix B, matrix Res)
{
   register int Outer, Inner, Index;

   for (Outer = 0; Outer < UPPERLIMIT; Outer++)
      for (Inner = 0; Inner < UPPERLIMIT; Inner++)
      {
         Res [Outer][Inner] = 0;
         for (Index = 0; Index < UPPERLIMIT; Index++)
            Res[Outer][Inner]  +=
               A[Outer][Index] * B[Index][Inner];
       }
}

This function multiplies two matrices. It uses three nested loops: Outer, Inner, and Index.

I'll start by identifying the basic blocks and then map the data flow and control flow.

1. **Basic Blocks Identification:**
   - The entire function is a single loop structure with multiple levels.
   - The outermost loop over Outer (lines 2-).
     Inside this loop, there's another loop over Inner (line 3-).
       Inside that, an initialization of Res[Outer][Inner] to 0 (line 4) and then a third loop over Index (line 5-).

2. **Data Flow Analysis:**
   - Variables involved:
     - Outer, Inner, Index
     - A, B, Res (matrices)
   - For each variable, track defs and uses.

3. **Control Flow Analysis:**
   - Each loop has a condition that determines if the loop continues.
   - The structure is nested loops with no conditional branches except for the loop conditions.

4. **Nodes in CDFG:**
   Each basic block or significant operation will be a node. Let's list each step:

   - Node 1: Start of Multiply function, initializing Outer to 0.
   - Node 2: Check if Outer < UPPERLIMIT. If true, proceed; else, exit (double circle).
   - Node 3: Increment Outer.
   - Node 4: Initialize Inner to 0.
   - Node 5: Check if Inner < UPPERLIMIT. If true, proceed; else, go to next part after inner loop.
   - Node 6: Increment Inner.
   - Node 7: Set Res[Outer][Inner] = 0.
   - Node 8: Initialize Index to 0.
   - Node 9: Check if Index < UPPERLIMIT. If true, proceed; else, continue after index loop.
   - Node 10: Multiply A[Outer][Index] and B[Index][Inner], add to Res[Outer][Inner].
   - Node 11: Increment Index.
   - Node 12: After innermost loop, check if next Inner iteration or proceed.

Wait, maybe I should structure it differently. Since each loop has its own control flow, perhaps breaking it down into nodes for each loop condition and body.

Alternatively, considering that the code is a series of nested loops without any conditionals (except for loop conditions), the CDFG will consist of sequential nodes with edges based on loop conditions.

Let me try to outline each step:

- Start: Enter Multiply function.
- Node 1: Loop over Outer from 0 to UPPERLIMIT - 1.
   - Check if Outer < UPPERLIMIT. If not, exit (Node Exit).
   - Else, proceed to inner loops.
- For each iteration of Outer:
   - Node 2: Loop over Inner from 0 to UPPERLIMIT - 1.
      - Check if Inner < UPPERLIMIT. If not, go to next step after inner loop.
      - Else, proceed to index loop.
   - For each Inner iteration:
      - Node 3: Set Res[Outer][Inner] = 0.
      - Node 4: Loop over Index from 0 to UPPERLIMIT -1.
         - Check if Index < UPPERLIMIT. If not, continue after index loop.
         - Else, compute the product and add to Res.
      - After innermost loop, proceed.

Wait, perhaps each of these steps can be represented as nodes with control flow edges.

I think I need to list each statement as a node and connect them based on control flow.

Let me try:

1. Node 1: Start of Multiply function.
2. Node 2: Initialize Outer = 0.
3. Node 3: Check if Outer < UPPERLIMIT.
   - If true, proceed; else, go to exit (Node X).
4. Node 4: Increment Outer.
5. Node 5: For each Outer, initialize Inner = 0.
6. Node 6: Check if Inner < UPPERLIMIT.
   - If true, proceed; else, increment Outer and check again.
7. Node 7: Increment Inner.
8. Node 8: Set Res[Outer][Inner] = 0.
9. Node 9: Initialize Index = 0.
10. Node 10: Check if Index < UPPERLIMIT.
    - If true, proceed; else, go to next step after index loop.
11. Node 11: Compute A[O][I] * B[I][In], add to Res.
12. Node 12: Increment Index.
13. After innermost loop, go back to Node 6.

Wait, this is getting a bit complicated. Maybe it's better to represent each loop as a cycle in the CDFG.

Alternatively, perhaps using traditional CFG where each node represents a basic block. Each basic block is a single statement or a group of statements that are executed sequentially without any jumps.

In this case:

- The function starts with the outer loop.
   - So first node: for (Outer=0; ... ) {
      Which includes the inner loops.

But perhaps it's better to break down each loop into its own structure.

Let me outline the code step by step, assigning each significant statement a node:

1. Node 1: Start of function.
2. Node 2: for (Outer = 0; Outer < UPPERLIMIT; Outer++) {
3. Node 3: Check if Outer < UPPERLIMIT (condition for outer loop).
   - If true, proceed to inner loops; else, exit (Node X with double circle).
4. Node 4: Increment Outer.
5. Node 5: for (Inner = 0; Inner < UPPERLIMIT; Inner++) {
6. Node 6: Check if Inner < UPPERLIMIT.
   - If true, proceed; else, go to after inner loop (i.e., increment Outer and check again).
7. Node 7: Increment Inner.
8. Node 8: Res[Outer][Inner] = 0;
9. Node 9: for (Index = 0; Index < UPPERLIMIT; Index++) {
10. Node 10: Check if Index < UPPERLIMIT.
    - If true, proceed; else, continue after index loop.
11. Node 11: Compute product and add to Res.
12. Node 12: Increment Index.
13. After index loop, go back to Node 6.

But this might not capture all the flows correctly. Alternatively, each loop can be represented with its own condition node, and the body nodes connected accordingly.

Wait, perhaps I should model it as follows:

- The outer loop (Outer) has a condition node that either exits or loops back.
   - If exited, it goes to the exit node.
- Inside Outer's true branch:
   - Inner loop starts with its own condition node.
      - If false, it increments Outer and checks again.
      - If true, proceeds to index loop.
         - Index loop has its own condition, etc.

This seems complex but manageable.

Let me try to structure each part:

1. Start (Node 0)
2. Outer loop initialization: Outer = 0 (Node 1)
3. Check Outer < UPPERLIMIT (Node 2)
   - If true: proceed; else, exit (Node X).
4. Increment Outer (Node 3)
5. Inner loop: Inner = 0 (Node 4)
6. Check Inner < UPPERLIMIT (Node 5)
   - If true: proceed; else, go to Node 3.
7. Increment Inner (Node 6)
8. Set Res[O][I] = 0 (Node 7)
9. Index loop: Index = 0 (Node 8)
10. Check Index < UPPERLIMIT (Node 9)
    - If true: proceed; else, go to Node 6.
11. Compute product and add (Node 10)
12. Increment Index (Node 11)
13. After index loop, go back to Node 5.

Wait, after the index loop ends, we should return to check Inner again.

But perhaps in the CDFG, after each loop's body, there's a jump back to the condition node.

This would create cycles in the graph.

Alternatively, using labels for the jumps:

- After setting Res[O][I] = 0 (Node 7), we enter the index loop.
   - After processing the index loop, we go back to check Inner again (Node 5).
- When Inner reaches its limit, after index loops, it increments Inner and checks again.

But in code, once Inner loop ends, the next step is to increment Outer and restart.

Hmm, this is getting a bit tangled. Maybe I should consider each loop separately.

Alternatively, perhaps represent the entire function as a series of nodes where:

- The outer loop has its own condition.
   - If true, process inner loops.
- Each inner iteration goes through setting Res and index loop.
- Then, after inner loops finish, increment Outer and check again.

But I think it's better to model each loop with its condition node and body nodes connected accordingly.

Let me try to outline the nodes:

1. Start (Node 0)
2. Node 1: for (Outer = 0; ... )
3. Node 2: if Outer < UL, else exit.
4. If true:
   - Node 3: increment Outer
5. Node 4: for (Inner = 0; ... )
6. Node 5: if Inner >= UL, go to Node 3 (increment Outer and check again).
7. Else:
   - Node 6: increment Inner
8. Node 7: Res[O][I] = 0
9. Node 8: for (Index=0; ... )
10. Node 9: if Index >= UL, go to Node 5 (check Inner again)
11. Else:
    - Node 10: compute product and add
12. Node 11: increment Index

Wait, perhaps this isn't capturing the correct flow because after the index loop completes, we should return to checking Inner.

Alternatively, each time a loop ends, it jumps back to the condition of the next enclosing loop.

This is getting complex, but I think the key is to model each loop's condition as a node with edges based on whether the condition is met.

Let me try to define each node and its control flow:

- Node 0: Start
   - Goes to Node 1 (Outer loop initialization)
- Node 1: Outer = 0
   - Goes to Node 2
- Node 2: Check if Outer < UL
   - If true: go to Node 3 (increment Outer)
   - Else: exit to Node X (exit node with double circle)
- Node 3: Outer++
   - Goes to Node 4 (Inner loop start)
- Node 4: Inner = 0
   - Goes to Node 5
- Node 5: Check if Inner < UL
   - If true: go to Node 6 (increment Inner)
   - Else: go to Node 3 (to increment Outer and check again)
- Node 6: Inner++
   - Goes to Node 7
- Node 7: Res[O][I] = 0
   - Goes to Node 8 (Index loop start)
- Node 8: Index = 0
   - Goes to Node 9
- Node 9: Check if Index < UL
   - If true: go to Node 10 (compute product and add)
   - Else: go to Node 5 (check Inner again)
- Node 10: Compute A[O][Index] * B[Index][I] and add to Res
   - Goes to Node 11 (increment Index)
- Node 11: Index++
   - Goes back to Node 9

Wait, that seems correct. So after computing in Node 10, we increment Index and loop back to check if Index is still < UL.

When the innermost loop ends (Index >= UL), it goes back to Node 5 to check Inner again.

If Inner also reaches its limit, it increments Inner and loops back to check again.

Once both Inner and Outer loops are done, it exits at Node X.

So putting this all together:

Nodes:

0: Start
1: Outer = 0
2: if Outer < UL
3: Outer++
4: Inner = 0
5: if Inner < UL
6: Inner++
7: Res[O][I] = 0
8: Index = 0
9: if Index < UL
10: compute and add
11: Index++

Edges:

0 -> 1
1 -> 2
2: true ->3; false->X (exit)
3 ->4
4 ->5
5: true->6; false->3
6->7
7->8
8->9
9: true->10; false->5
10->11
11->9

Exit node X is when either outer or inner loops finish.

Now, for the data flow:

Each variable's def and use points need to be tracked. For example:

- Outer is defined at Node 1 (initialization), used in comparisons at Nodes 2,3.
- Inner is initialized at Node4, used in Nodes5,6,7.
- Index is initialized at Node8, used in Nodes9,10,11.

The matrices A, B, Res are accessed throughout with their indices.

Each access (A[O][Index], B[Index][I]) would be nodes where these variables are read and written.

But perhaps for simplicity, since the data flow is straightforward, we can represent dependencies in the nodes as needed.

Putting it all together, the CDFG will have these nodes connected with control flows, and each node may have data dependencies (like using Outer, Inner, Index variables).

Now, translating this into Graphviz DOT format:

- Nodes 0 to 11 as described.
- Exit node X is a sink.

I'll represent each node with a label indicating its operation.

Edges will be directed from one node to another based on the control flow.

Let me draft the DOT code step by step:

Nodes:
- 0: Start
- 1: for (Outer = 0;
- 2: if (Outer < UPPERLIMIT) {
- 3: Outer++;
- 4: for (Inner = 0;
- 5: if (Inner < UPPERLIMIT) {
- 6: Inner++;
- 7: Res[Outer][Inner] = 0;
- 8: for (Index = 0;
- 9: if (Index < UPPERLIMIT) {
-10: Res[O][I] += A[O][Index] * B[Index][I];
-11: Index++;

Edges:

0 ->1
1 ->2
2 ->3 [true], 2->X [false]
3->4
4->5
5->6 [true], 5->3 [false]
6->7
7->8
8->9
9->10 [true], 9->5 [false]
10->11
11->9

Exit node X is a double circle.

Now, I'll write the DOT code with these nodes and edges, including data dependencies where necessary.

I think that's the plan. Now, let me structure this into the required format.
