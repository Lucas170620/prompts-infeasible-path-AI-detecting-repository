To generate the Control and Data Flow Graph (CDFG) for the provided `Multiply` function in Graphviz DOT format, we first analyze the control flow and data usage within the nested loops. The CDFG captures both the sequence of operations and the dependencies between variables.

### Control Flow Graph Structure:
1. **Nodes** represent basic blocks or significant points in the code.
2. **Edges** represent control flows between nodes.
3. **Data Dependencies** are noted within each node where applicable.

The function's structure involves three nested loops without any conditional branches except for loop conditions, resulting in a straightforward yet nested control flow.

### CDFG in Graphviz DOT Format:
```dot
digraph Multiply_CDFG {
    node [shape=rectangle];
    Exit [shape=circle, label="", style=invis];
    
    0[label="Start"];
    1[label="for (Outer = 0;"];
    2[label="if (Outer < UPPERLIMIT)"];
    3[label="Outer++"];
    4[label="for (Inner = 0;"];
    5[label="if (Inner < UPPERLIMIT)"];
    6[label="Inner++"];
    7[label="Res[Outer][Inner] = 0;"];
    8[label="for (Index = 0;"];
    9[label="if (Index < UPPERLIMIT)"];
    10[label="Res[O][I] += A[O][Index] * B[Index][I];"];
    11[label="Index++"];

    0 -> 1;
    1 -> 2;
    2 -> 3 [label="true"];
    2 -> Exit [label="false"];
    3 -> 4;
    4 -> 5;
    5 -> 6 [label="true"];
    5 -> 3 [label="false"];
    6 -> 7;
    7 -> 8;
    8 -> 9;
    9 -> 10 [label="true"];
    9 -> 5 [label="false"];
    10 -> 11;
    11 -> 9;
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Nodes**: Each node represents a specific operation or loop condition. For example, `2` is the outermost loop's condition check.
- **Edges**: Directed edges show control flow. A true edge (labeled "true") indicates the loop continues; a false edge leads to termination (`Exit`).
- **Data Dependencies**: Not explicitly shown but inferred where variables like `Outer`, `Inner`, and `Index` are used.

This CDFG accurately represents the nested loops' structure and control flow, ensuring clarity in understanding the function's execution.
