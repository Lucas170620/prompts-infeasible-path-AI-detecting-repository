Okay, so I need to analyze the `InitSeed` function and its CDFG to identify any infeasible paths. Let me start by understanding what's given.

The function is pretty simple. It just initializes a global variable called Seed to zero. The code looks like this:

void InitSeed(void)
{
   Seed = 0;
}

Looking at the CDFG provided, it has two nodes. Node 1 represents the assignment of Seed to 0, and node 2 is the exit point.

Now, I need to follow the steps outlined in the task.

**Passo 1: Mapeamento Código-CDFG**

I should map each node and edge in the CDFG to the corresponding code lines. From the description:

- Node 1 corresponds to the line where Seed is assigned 0.
- Node 2 is the exit point, which isn't directly part of any code line but represents the end of the function.

So, the edges would be from node 1 (the assignment) pointing to node 2 (exit).

**Passo 2: Identificação de Caminhos Potenciais**

The CDFG for InitSeed is straightforward. The only path starts at node 1 and goes to node 2. There are no branches or loops, so there's only one possible path.

Possible paths:
- Node 1 -> Node 2

That's it since the function doesn't have any conditionals or loops to create alternative paths.

**Passo 3: Classificação de Inviabilidade**

I need to check if this single path is feasible. Since the function just assigns a value and exits, there are no conditions that could make this path invalid. The assignment of Seed = 0 is always valid regardless of any external factors because it's a direct assignment.

So, this path isn't infeasible by any logical or data flow criteria. There are no contradictions here. The function will always execute this path whenever InitSeed is called.

**Passo 4: Análise de Viabilidade por Critério**

Let me go through each criterion:

1. **Dados**: Seed is a global variable, but in the context of this function, it's being initialized. There's no issue here because it's assigned a value regardless of previous states.
2. **Lógica**: No logical conditions are present that could lead to contradictions since there's only an assignment statement.
3. **Contexto**: The function doesn't rely on any external state or inputs other than itself, so context isn't an issue.
4. **Loop**: There are no loops in this function.

All criteria indicate that the path is feasible.

**Passo 5: Consolidação**

Since there's only one path and it's clearly feasible, there are no infeasible paths to report here. The function behaves as expected every time it's called.
