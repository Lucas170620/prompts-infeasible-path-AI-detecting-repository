**Final Answer:**

After analyzing each function's CDFG, no infeasible paths were detected. All loops terminate correctly, and there are no logical contradictions or impossible conditions in the code.

- **Functions Analyzed:** `Test`, `Initialize`, `RandomInteger`, `Multiply`
- **Infeasible Paths Identified:** None
- **Conclusion:** The provided code is free of infeasible paths based on the analysis.
