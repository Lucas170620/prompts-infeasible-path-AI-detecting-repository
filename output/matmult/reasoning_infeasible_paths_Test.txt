Okay, so I have to analyze the Test function and its Control and Data Flow Graph (CDFG) to identify any infeasible paths. Let's go through this step by step.

First, let me understand what the Test function does. From the code provided, it initializes two matrices A and B, then calls Multiply to compute the product and store it in Res. The timing parts are commented out because of conditional compilation, so we're focusing on the core functionality.

Looking at the CDFG for the Test function:

- There are three nodes: node1 (Initialize(A)), node2 (Initialize(B)), and node3 (Multiply(A,B,Res)).
- Control flow edges go from node1 to node2, then to node3.
- Data flow edges show that A is passed from node1 to node3, B from node2 to node3.

Now, I need to look for infeasible paths. Let's think about possible paths:

The control flow seems straightforward: it always goes through Initialize(A), then Initialize(B), and finally Multiply. Since there are no conditionals or loops that branch the execution, all nodes must be executed in sequence every time.

Wait a minute—could there be any conditions within these functions that might make certain data dependencies invalid? Let's check each function.

1. **Initialize(matrix Array)**:
   - This initializes the matrix with random integers.
   - Are there any constraints on Seed or the generated values? The RandomInteger function uses modulo 8095, so values are between 0 and 8094.

2. **Multiply(matrix A, matrix B, matrix Res)**:
   - It performs standard matrix multiplication. Each element is computed as the sum of products of corresponding row from A and column from B.
   - No conditions here except loops. Since matrices are square and fixed size (UPPERLIMIT=20), all indices are within bounds.

3. **Test()**:
   - Initializes A, then B, then calls Multiply.
   - All variables are initialized before use, so no uninitialized variable issues.

Wait, but what about the data flow? Let's see:

- node1 (Initialize(A)) defines A. It is used in node3.
- node2 (Initialize(B)) defines B, also used in node3.
- There are no other dependencies; Res is only defined in Multiply, which is correct as it's passed by reference.

Since all nodes are executed and there are no conditional branches in the Test function itself, every execution path is feasible. The control flow doesn't diverge based on conditions—so all possible paths (which is just one path) are viable.

But let me double-check: Could any internal operation within Initialize or Multiply create a situation where data dependencies are violated?

In Initialize(A), since it's initializing A with random integers, but the function itself doesn't have any conditional logic that could lead to contradictions. Similarly for Initialize(B).

Multiply is straightforward matrix multiplication without conditionals, so no issues there either.

Therefore, considering all possible execution paths and their data dependencies, every path in the CDFG is feasible. There are no static or dynamic conditions within this specific Test function that would make any path inviable.
