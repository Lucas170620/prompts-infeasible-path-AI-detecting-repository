Okay, I need to generate a CDFG (Control and Data Flow Graph) in Graphviz DOT format for the function RandomInteger. Let me start by understanding what this function does.

Looking at the code:

int RandomInteger(void)
{
   Seed = ((Seed * 133) + 81) % 8095;
   return (Seed);
}

So, the function takes no arguments and returns an int. It modifies the global variable Seed by performing some calculations and then returns the new value of Seed.

First, I'll break down each step in the function to identify basic blocks and data flow.

1. The first line is Seed = ((Seed * 133) + 81) % 8095;
   - This redefines Seed based on its previous value.
2. Then it returns Seed.

I notice there are no conditionals or loops here, so the function has a single basic block with two statements.

Now, for the CDFG:

- Nodes represent basic blocks.
- Each node will have labels indicating data definitions (def) and uses (use).
- Since this is a simple function without control flow changes, it's straightforward.

I'll number each statement as separate nodes. The first node handles updating Seed, and the second returns the value.

The edges will show the flow between these nodes. Since there are no conditionals or jumps, it's a linear flow: Node 1 -> Node 2 -> Node 3 (exit).

Each node's label should describe what happens and any data involved.

Let me structure the DOT code:

- Start with digraph RandomInteger.
- Set rankdir=TB for top-to-bottom layout.
- Each node has shape=circle.
- Node labels include definitions and uses.

For the mapping part, each node corresponds to a line of code. I'll explain what each node represents in terms of code snippets.

I think that's it. Now, I'll put this together into the required format.
