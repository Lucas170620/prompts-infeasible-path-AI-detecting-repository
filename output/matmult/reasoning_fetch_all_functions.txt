Alright, so I need to analyze the given C code and extract all the user-defined function names. The user mentioned to ignore built-in or library functions, only list each function once per line, preserving their case, and include even the main function.

First, I'll go through the code step by step. Let's see:

The code starts with some comments and then defines a constant UPPSALAWCET. Then there are several function declarations. 

Looking at the functions declared or defined:

1. There's a `main()` function, which is the standard entry point in C programs.

2. The `InitSeed()` function initializes the seed for the random number generator.

3. The `Test()` function seems to set up matrices and measure time, but under UPPSALAWCET, it doesn't print or time, so the actual functionality is commented out.

4. The `Initialize(matrix Array)` function fills the matrix with random integers.

5. The `RandomInteger(void)` function generates a random integer using the seed.

6. Under the condition of not being UPPSALAWCET, there's an `ttime()` function which measures time, but it's ignored in that case.

7. Finally, the `Multiply(matrix A, matrix B, matrix Res)` function performs matrix multiplication.

I should list all these functions as per their declaration or definition in the code, regardless of whether they're used elsewhere. So the main points are:

- main()
- InitSeed()
- Test()
- Initialize()
- RandomInteger()
- Multiply()

Wait, but I also noticed that `ttime()` is defined inside an #ifndef UPPSALAWCET block, which means it's only present if not UPPSALAWCET. So in the code provided, since UPPSALAWCET is defined at the top, `ttime()` would be excluded. Therefore, I shouldn't include it.

So the functions to list are:

main(), InitSeed(), Test(), Initialize(), RandomInteger(), Multiply().

I need to make sure each is on a new line without any additional formatting.
