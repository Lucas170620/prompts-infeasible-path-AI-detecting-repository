Okay, I need to analyze the provided code and its corresponding CDFG to identify any infeasible paths. Let's start by understanding the function foo(int x) and then look at the CDFG structure.

The function foo loops through four indices i, j, k, l from 0 to 4 each. For each combination, it checks if keys[i][j][k][l] equals x. If so, it returns the sum of answer[i][j][k][l] and keys[i][j][k][l]. If no match is found after all loops, it returns -1.

Looking at the CDFG, each loop iteration is a node (3, 4, 5, 6), and the condition check is node 7. The edges represent control flow based on whether the condition is true or false.

Now, let's think about possible infeasible paths. Since all loops are independent and the conditions only depend on keys[i][j][k][l] == x, each path represents a specific set of indices where this equality holds.

Wait, but can a variable be undefined? The variables i, j, k, l are initialized at each loop start, so they shouldn't cause issues. Also, since the code is inside loops, every possible combination is checked unless there's a condition that makes some paths impossible to reach.

Hmm, considering the termination condition for loops: each loop runs from 0 to less than 5, so all four loops will always complete. Therefore, any path through these loops is feasible as long as i, j, k, l are within bounds.

But wait, what about the keys and answer arrays? Are they always initialized? From the code snippet provided, it seems that both keys and answer are multi-dimensional arrays with 5x5x5x5 elements. The last element of keys in the example is [4][4][4][4] = 1111, which suggests that all elements except possibly one are initialized.

However, for the function foo, as long as x matches any of the keys[i][j][k][l], it will return a value. If no match is found after all iterations, it returns -1.

I'm trying to think if there's any logical contradiction in the code paths. For example, in each loop iteration, i, j, k, l are incremented from 0 to 4. There's no condition that would make a particular combination impossible unless x cannot be present in the keys array at all.

Wait, but for the function foo(400), which is called in main(), let's see if 400 exists in any of the keys[i][j][k][l]. Looking at the provided keys structure:

The last element of the keys array is [4][4][4][4] = 1111, and others before that are 4 followed by various numbers. For example, I see elements like 400 in the description, but looking closely, wait no: actually, looking at the structure provided:

The user's code shows a keys array with some specific values. Wait, the last line is:

keys[4][4][4][4] = 1111.

Wait, so I don't see any 400 in the keys array. Because all elements are either numbers like 4, or other numbers but not exactly 400. So if x is 400, none of the keys[i][j][k][l] will be equal to x, meaning the function will return -1.

Therefore, when foo(400) is called, all loops run, but no condition is met, so it returns -1. There are no infeasible paths because all possible loop iterations are executed without any contradictions.

Wait, but let me double-check the keys array structure provided by the user. In their code snippet, I don't see 400 anywhere. So when foo(400) is called, it will go through all loops and return -1. Since no condition is met, there are no paths that lead to returning a value other than -1.

Therefore, in this case, all possible paths (all combinations of i, j, k, l) are feasible because the function correctly proceeds through each iteration without any logical contradictions or uninitialized variables.
