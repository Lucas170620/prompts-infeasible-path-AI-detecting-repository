To identify infeasible paths in the provided code based on its CDFG, we analyze each possible execution path and determine which ones cannot occur under any circumstances. The key observation is that certain conditions within nested loops can never be met due to loop termination constraints.

### Infeasible Paths Identified:

1. **Path: Node1 → Node2 (i >=5)**
   - This path attempts to exit the outermost loop when `i` is 5 or more, which cannot happen because `i` only runs from 0 to 4.
   
2. **Path: Node3 → Node4 (j >=5)**
   - Exits the j-loop when `j` is beyond its limit (>=5), impossible as `j` iterates up to 4.

3. **Path: Node5 → Node6 (k >=5)**
   - Tries to exit k-loop with `k` >=5, which never occurs.

4. **Path: Node7 → Node8 (l >=5)**
   - Exits l-loop when `l` is beyond its limit (>=5), impossible as it only goes up to 4.

These paths are infeasible because the loop conditions ensure variables never exceed their bounds, making these exits impossible.

### Final Answer

The identified infeasible paths are those where any of the loop exit conditions (`i >=5`, `j >=5`, etc.) are met, as these cannot occur during execution. These paths are static infeasibilities due to the loop structure ensuring variables never reach such values.

\boxed{
\text{Infeasible Paths: Any path taking a false branch on loop termination conditions (e.g., }i \geq 5\text{, }j \geq 5\text{).}
}
