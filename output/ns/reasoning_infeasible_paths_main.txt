Okay, I need to analyze the given code and its CDFG to identify any infeasible paths. Let me start by understanding the context.

The main function calls foo(400), and depending on whether TEST is defined, it either prints the result or just returns. The CDFG provided shows two possible execution paths: one where TEST is defined (leading to a printf call) and another where it's not (just calling foo).

Looking at the code for main(), when TEST is defined, it executes printf with the result of foo(400). When TEST isn't defined, it just calls foo(400) without printing. So both paths are possible based on the preprocessor macro.

Now, I should check if any of these paths are infeasible. Let's consider each path:

1. **TEST is defined:**
   - The code enters the if block and calls printf.
   - This requires that TEST is true during compilation. If it's not defined, this path isn't taken, but since we're considering both possibilities, I need to check if there are any logical contradictions here.

2. **TEST is not defined:**
   - The code skips the printf call and directly calls foo.
   - Again, no immediate contradictions unless there's a data dependency issue.

But wait, looking deeper into the main function, when TEST is defined, it prints "result=%d" using the result of foo(400). Since foo returns an integer, this should be fine. When TEST isn't defined, it just calls foo without using its return value, which is allowed in C unless the function expects a return value, but main() returning void is okay.

I don't see any logical contradictions or data dependencies that would make either path impossible. Both paths are valid based on whether TEST is defined or not. Therefore, neither of these execution paths is infeasible.
