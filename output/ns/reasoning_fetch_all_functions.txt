Alright, I need to analyze the given code and extract all user-defined function or method names. I should ignore built-in functions and library functions. Let's look through the code step by step.

Starting from the top, I see a struct definition for 'time' with several members like tm_sec, tm_min, etc. That's part of a struct, not a function, so I can skip that.

Next, there are some variables declared: timeVariable, currentYear, daysInMonth, monthName, and dateCount. These are variable declarations, not functions, so no need to note them down.

Moving further down, I come across a function named 'printDate'. It's defined using the keyword 'void' followed by the function name. That's definitely a user-defined function, so I should add 'printDate' to my list.

Then there's another function called 'calculateTotalDays', which returns an integer. This is also a user-defined function, so I'll include it as well.

Following that, there's a main function, which is standard in C programs. Since the task includes functions like main, I should add 'main' to my list.

I don't see any other function declarations in the code. The rest of the code seems to be variable declarations or struct definitions.

So, compiling all the user-defined functions I found: printDate, calculateTotalDays, and main.
