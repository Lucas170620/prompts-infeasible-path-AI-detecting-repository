To analyze the given C code and its Control and Data Flow Graph (CDFG) for infeasible paths, we focus on the conditional checks and variable dependencies within the des() function. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. **Node Mapping**: Each node represents a basic block of code. Nodes 3-5 handle the initial condition based on `value`, while subsequent nodes (6-34) manage loops and further conditions.

2. **Identifying Conditions**:
   - Node 3 splits execution based on whether `value` is 1 or 0.
   - Nodes 7, 18, and 29 involve checks on variables `j` and `jj`, which might be influenced by prior assignments.

3. **Infeasible Path Detection**:
   - If `value` is always 0, the path through Node 4 becomes unreachable.
   - Variables like `j` or `jj` may have fixed values due to earlier logic, making certain conditions impossible (e.g., `jj >=1` when `jj` is set to 0).

4. **Conclusion**: Several paths are infeasible based on variable assignments and prior logic. For example, if `value` is always 0, the path through Node 4 is dead code.

**Answer**:
Based on the analysis of the CDFG structure and possible variable dependencies:

- Nodes 3-5: The path through Node 4 is infeasible when `value` is 0.
- Nodes 7 onwards: Conditions involving `j` and `jj` may lead to dead paths if variables are assigned values that make certain conditions impossible.

Thus, multiple infeasible paths exist due to variable assignments making certain condition branches unreachable. 

The final answer is:

\boxed{\text{Infeasible paths exist where variable assignments prevent certain condition branches from being executed.}}
