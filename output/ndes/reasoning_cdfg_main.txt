Okay, I need to create a precise CDFG (Control and Data Flow Graph) for the given main function in the provided C code using Graphviz DOT. Let me start by understanding the task.

First, I'll look at the code structure. The main function initializes some variables, calls des(), and returns 0. There are helper functions like des() which likely implement DES encryption, but for this analysis, I'm focusing on main.

I need to identify all basic blocks in the main function. Since it's a simple function without loops or conditionals, each line is a single block except for the call to des(), which might be a complex node due to parameters and variables involved.

Next, I'll map definitions (def) and uses (c-use/p-use). The variables inp.l, inp.r, key.l, key.r are defined in lines 2-5. newkey and isw are initialized with 'value' which comes from a conditional compilation directive. Then, des() is called, using these variables as parameters.

Constructing the CDFG: Nodes represent basic blocks, edges represent control flow. The first node initializes inp, then key, then newkey and isw. Then it calls des(), leading to the return statement.

I'll number each node sequentially. Node 1 will handle initializing inp, node 2 for key, node3 for newkey and isw, node4 for the function call, and node5 as the exit with doublecircle shape.

Edges connect nodes in order since there's a single path except after des(), which leads to the end.

Now, I'll write the DOT code. Nodes will be labeled with their code snippets and dataflow info. Edges are straightforward, just arrows from one node to the next.

Finally, the mapping part will list each node with its corresponding code snippet and data flow details.
