Alright, I need to analyze the provided code and extract only the names of all user-defined functions or methods. I should ignore built-in or library functions. The output should list each function name on a new line, preserving their case, without any numbers, bullets, or extra characters.

Looking at the code, I see several function declarations. Let me go through them one by one.

First, there's the `des` function. It's declared as:

void des(immense inp, immense key, int *newkey, int isw, immense *out);

Then, inside `des`, there's a call to `main()`. So I should note down all functions, including `main`.

Looking further, within the code, the function `main` is defined. That's another one.

Additionally, in the code provided, there are other helper functions like `ietmp1`, but those are variables or expressions, not function names. 

Wait, wait. Let me check again. The user might have other functions inside the code. Looking through the entire code, I see that `des` is a function, and `main` is another. Are there any others?

Looking at the code, after `des`, it's all part of `main`. There are no other function declarations like `void someFunction() { ... }` except for `des` and `main`.

Wait, wait, inside the `des` function, there are calls to functions like `printf`, but those are built-in. So I shouldn't include them.

Also, within the code of `des`, especially in the `ietmp1` section, there's a lot of code, but no new function declarations.

So, compiling this, the user-defined functions are:

1. des
2. main

I think that's all.
