Based on the analysis of the CDFG and the cl_block function, there are specific paths that cannot be executed due to the initial value of variable i being set to -16. This makes certain loops impossible to enter.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **Mapping Nodes to Code Sections:**
   - Node 1 sets `i = -16` and adjusts `htab_p`.
   - Node 2 modifies `i` further, making it more negative.
   - Nodes 3 and 4 involve a loop that runs while `i > 0`.

2. **Identifying Infeasible Paths:**
   - After Node1 and Node2, `i` is set to -24, which is less than zero.
   - Therefore, the loop condition at Node3 (`while (i > 0)`) cannot be satisfied.

3. **Conclusion on Feasibility:**
   - Any path through Nodes3→4 is infeasible because `i` starts negative and becomes more so, preventing the loop from executing.

**Final Answer:**

The only infeasible paths are those that pass through Nodes 3 and 4 due to the initial value of `i` being negative, making the loop impossible. Specifically:

- **Path A:** 1 →2→3→4→5→6→8 is infeasible because after Node2, `i` becomes -24, so the condition at Node3 is false.

Thus, any path that includes Nodes3 and 4 cannot be executed under normal circumstances.
