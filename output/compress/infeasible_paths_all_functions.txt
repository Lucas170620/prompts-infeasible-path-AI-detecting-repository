**Analysis of Infeasible Paths in Code - Structural Testing Expert**

**Instructions Given:**
Provide:
1. The source code to be analyzed
2. For each function in the code, include:
   - The corresponding **CDFG (Control Data Flow Graph)**
   - An initial analysis indicating possible *infeasible paths* identified

---

**Analysis Process (Automatically Executed):**

**1. Function CDFG Mapping**
For each function in the code:
- Identify critical nodes (e.g., branches with data-dependent conditions)
- Map CDFG edges to corresponding code sections

**2. Detection of Infeasible Paths**
Analyze each path in the CDFG considering:
- **Data Dependencies:** Paths where variables have conflicting states
- **Logical Constraints:** Mutually exclusive conditions (e.g., `(x > 0 && x < 0)`)
- **Loop Invariants:** Paths violating loop exit conditions
- **Dead Code:** Unreachable blocks identified in the CDFG

**3. Classification of Infeasibility**
Categorize each infeasible path as:
- **Statically Infeasible:** Infeasible across all executions (e.g., contradictory logic)
- **Dynamically Infeasible:** Infeasible under specific input conditions

**4. Consolidated Report**
Generate for each function:
- List of infeasible paths with code location
- Technical justification based on CDFG analysis
- Impact on structural test coverage
- Recommendations for refining the CDFG/code

**Expected Output Example:**

```
Function: calculate_grade
- Infeasible Path #1: Nodes [A3→B5→C7]
  Reason: Condition "score > 100 && score < 50" is logically impossible
  Effect: Dead code detected in block C7
- Infeasible Path #2: Nodes [A3→D9]
  Reason: Variable 'initialized' must be false at A3 but true at D9
```

**Technical Note:** This analysis assumes the provided CDFG accurately reflects control and data flow. Detected infeasibilities may indicate optimization opportunities or code review needs.

**Answer:**

Based on the provided code and CDFGs, the functions analyzed have the following infeasible paths:

### Function: `main`
- **Analysis Outcome:** No infeasible paths identified. The CDFG indicates that all paths are reachable under certain input conditions, with no logical contradictions or impossible data dependencies detected.

### Function: `output`
- **Infeasible Path #1:**
  - **Code Location:** Nodes Nó2 → Nó3 → Nó4 → Nó8
  - **Reason:** If `free_ent` never exceeds `maxcode` and `clear_flg` is never set, this path becomes unreachable.
- **Infeasible Path #2:**
  - **Code Location:** Nodes Nó1 → Nó2 → Nó3 → Nó4 → Nó8 → Nó9
  - **Reason:** Similar to the first, if certain conditions are never met, this path is dynamically infeasible.

### Other Functions (e.g., `main`, `calculate_grade`)
- For functions not explicitly analyzed here, such as `calculate_grade`, no specific infeasible paths were provided. However, based on typical code structure and logical constraints, it's essential to check for conditions that may lead to impossible scenarios, like contradictory variable states or unreachable blocks.

**Recommendation:**
For the `output` function, consider adding runtime checks or ensuring that variables `free_ent` and `clear_flg` are managed appropriately to cover all possible execution paths. For other functions, a thorough review of logical conditions and data dependencies is recommended to identify any potential dead code or infeasible paths.

**Final Answer:**

The analysis identified two infeasible paths in the `output` function:

1. **Path Involving Nodes Nó2 → Nó3 → Nó4 → Nó8**
   - This path is infeasible if `free_ent > maxcode || clear_flg` never evaluates to true.

2. **Path Involving Nodes Nó1 → Nó2 → Nó3 → Nó4 → Nó8 → Nó9**
   - Similarly infeasible under conditions where `free_ent` does not exceed `maxcode` and `clear_flg` remains unset.

For other functions like `main`, no infeasible paths were detected.
