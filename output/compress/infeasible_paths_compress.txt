Based on the analysis of the provided CDFG and code snippet, there do not appear to be any clear examples of logically impossible (statically infeasible) control flow paths. All potential paths seem to be feasible under certain conditions, given the proper management of variables like 'free_ent', 'maxcode', 'r_off', and 'bits' throughout the function.

**Answer:**

There are no statically infeasible paths identified in the provided CDFG for the `compress` function. All control flow paths appear to be feasible under appropriate conditions, given the proper initialization and management of variables involved.
