Okay, so I need to analyze the given code and identify any infeasible paths in each function. The user has already provided CDFGs for several functions, including main, output, and others. My task is to go through these and spot any impossible or unreachable paths based on data dependencies, logical constraints, loop invariants, etc.

Starting with the main function's CDFG:

Looking at node 2, there's a condition checking if InCnt > 0 and apsim_InCnt-- > 0. If true, it goes to node3; else, node4. Now, after that, from node3, it proceeds through nodes5 to node17, eventually reaching node18 with another condition involving free_ent and clear_flg.

I don't immediately see any logical contradictions here. The conditions seem possible under certain inputs, so main doesn't have infeasible paths as per the user's analysis.

Next, looking at the output function's CDFG:

There are two identified infeasible paths. Let me parse these:

1. Path from Nó2 → Nó3 → Nó4 → Nó8: The conditions free_ent > maxcode or clear_flg must be true. If neither ever happens, this path is unreachable.

2. Another path also involving the same conditions leading to Nó9. Again, if those flags are never set, this part of the code won't execute.

These seem valid because depending on how the program runs, certain global variables might not change states as required, making these paths dead code in some cases.

For other functions like main, no infeasible paths were found. Functions like calculate_grade weren't provided, but if they had similar conditions without logical contradictions, they'd have none either.

I think that's the gist of it. The output function has two possible dead paths under certain scenarios, while others are fine.
