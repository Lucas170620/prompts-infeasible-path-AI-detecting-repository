Alright, I need to analyze the provided code and extract all user-defined function names. Let me go through it step by step.

First, I'll look for any declarations of functions. In C, functions are declared with the format 'return_type function_name(parameters)'. Sometimes, they can also be declared as 'void function_name()'.

Looking at the code, I see several function definitions:

1. **initbuffer**: This is a void function that initializes some buffer.
2. **compress**: Another void function that seems to handle data compression.
3. **cl_block**: A void function, probably clearing some block or resetting parameters.
4. **cl_hash**: Also a void function, likely clearing some hash table.
5. **getbyte**: Returns an unsigned int and handles input byte retrieval.
6. **putbyte**: Returns void and writes a character to the output buffer.
7. **writebytes**: Writes multiple bytes to the output buffer.
8. **output**: Handles writing codes to the output, managing bitmasks and buffers.

I should also check if there are any other functions that might be declared but not defined within this code snippet. The main function is present as 'void main()'.

So, compiling all these function names:

- initbuffer
- compress
- cl_block
- cl_hash
- getbyte
- putbyte
- writebytes
- output
- main

I think that's all the user-defined functions in the provided code. I'll make sure to list each one on a new line without any additional formatting.
