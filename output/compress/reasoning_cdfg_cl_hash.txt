Okay, I need to generate a precise hybrid Control and Data Flow Graph (CDFG) in Graphviz DOT format for the function `cl_hash` provided. The user has given specific instructions on how to structure this graph, including node types, edge labels, and other details.

First, I'll analyze the `cl_hash` function. It's responsible for initializing an array with a certain value (0xFF) and then overwriting some elements based on a loop condition. Let me look at each line of code to understand what it does.

The function starts by declaring an array `htab` of size 8, initializes all elements to -1 using memset. Then it sets the first element (index 0) to 7. Next, there's a do-while loop that runs 16 times. Inside the loop, each iteration calculates an index based on `i`, sets the corresponding `htab[i]` value, and then continues.

I'll break down each basic block:

1. **Initialization of htab**: This is a single basic block where memset is called, initializing all elements to -1, and then setting htab[0] = 7.
2. **Loop Setup**: The loop starts with `i=0` and runs as long as `i < 16`.
3. **Inside the Loop**: For each iteration, it computes `htab[i]`, increments `i`, and checks if the loop should continue.

Now, I need to map each statement into nodes in the CDFG. Each node will represent a basic block or control structure. Nodes should show definitions (def) and uses (c-use/p-use) of variables.

For example, the first node will handle the memset and setting htab[0]. It defines `htab` but doesn't use any other variables except the parameters passed in.

Next, the loop condition is a decision point. I'll represent this with a diamond-shaped node. If `i < 16` is true, it proceeds; otherwise, it exits, marked as a double circle for the end.

Inside the loop body, there's an assignment to `htab[i]`, which is a computation and thus part of a process node. After that, `i` is incremented, another decision point checks the condition again, and so on until the loop ends.

I also need to label each node with their definitions and uses. For instance, when `htab` is being set in each block, it's a definition for that variable at that point.

Edges will represent control flow, labeled with conditions where applicable. Each basic operation within a block is a sequential node connected by edges without labels unless there's a condition or jump.

Finally, I'll number each node sequentially and connect them according to the control flow. The exit node will be marked as a double circle since it's the end of the function.
