Okay, so I need to analyze the given C code and extract only the names of all user-defined functions or methods. The rules say to ignore built-in or library functions. Let me look at the code provided.

The code starts with a function declaration: `int fib(int n)`. That's definitely a user-defined function, so "fib" should be on my list. Then there's another function `int main()`, which is also user-defined, even though it's the main function. So I need to include that as well.

I remember that in C, functions are declared with the syntax `tipo retorno nome(parametros)`. So I should look for lines that start with a type (like int, void, etc.), followed by a name, and then parentheses. Each of these names is a function I need to extract.

Let me go through each line:

1. The first line is `int fib(int n) { ... }` — so the function name is fib.
2. Then there's `int main() { ... }` — function name is main.

I don't see any other functions in this code snippet. So I only have two functions to list: fib and main.

Wait, but sometimes people might have helper functions inside or outside, but in this case, the code provided only has these two. So my final list should include both names.
